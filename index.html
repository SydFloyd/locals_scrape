        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>I know I said I was done posting music, here, but this is too wonderful to not share.</p>\n<p>From the bio--Ludovico Einaudi was on a North American tour, playing before audiences in the thousands, when he stopped by the NPR office to play a far more intimate setting: a Tiny Desk set. It\u2019s the first tour for the Italian pianist and composer since the beginning of the pandemic, following the release of his 2022 album, Underwater. It\u2019s an album that captures how many have felt in the pandemic \u2014 feeling underwater, or trapped in another world. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s that relatable feeling \u2014 like we\u2019re treading water trying to remain above the surface, powering through the adversity of the last two years \u2014 that makes Einaudi\u2019s music so emotional and reflective. The pulsating strings of the opening song to his Tiny Desk concert, the track \u201cExperience\u201d from his 2013 album In A Time Lapse, demand attention, captivating the audience. The fact that the song recently went viral due to a TikTok trend only proves how welcoming Einaudi\u2019s music is \u2014 and why he is the most-streamed classical pianist of all time.</p>\n<p>Ludovico Einaudi\u2019s presence at the piano keeps you waiting for more. His fingers glide over the keys effortlessly, but he never seems rushed. As he plays, his eyes are closed. And in this concert, you can tell his music moves him as much as it does his audience.</p>\n<p>SET LIST<br/>\n\u201cExperience\u201d<br/>\n\u201cFly\u201d<br/>\n\u201cFlora\u201d<br/>\n\u201cLow Mist\u201d</p>\n<p>MUSICIANS<br/>\nLudovico Einaudi: piano<br/>\nFederico Mecozzi: violin<br/>\nRedi Hasa: cello<br/>\nFrancesco Arcuri: percussion</p> </div>\n",

I would like to thank you for tolerating my daily posts of music over the past two years.  It has been a fun venture for me and I truly enjoyed it.  I hope it hasn\u2019t bored too many of you, and maybe, it has introduced you to some new things you may not have been inclined to listen to.  As we finish off the theme of girls named ROSE, we have a newer band, which is a rarity for me, as I am not too well versed in modern music.  For the record, my daughter turned me onto this one.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a newer band, Thee Sacred Souls, a San Diego based Soul Band.  Written by Alex Garcia, Josh Lane and Sal Samano.  It was released as a Single in 2020 and also on their self-titled debut album that same year.  Just smooth and beautiful, just like the name.  I just bought this album on vinyl and am waiting for it to be delivered.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I Call You Rose?</p> </div>\n",

You meet someone named Rose and you think of beauty and grace.  Just like you meet someone named \u201cNoah\u201d and you think of a spiritual person.  But in my experience, girls named Rose are either amazing women or hood-rats, just sayin\u2019.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the group Tony Orlando and Dawn.  Yeah, I know what you are thinking, \u201cTony Orlando and Dawn, REALLY???\u201d  Yes, mainly because they were so instrumental for music and artists in the early to mid 1970\u2019s.  They were popular and had a great variety show that gave a lot of artists exposure.  One of my favorite stories is how George Carlin was out of work and not doing too well, Tony gave him a job and kept his career going for him.  The song was written by Irwin Levine (lyrics) and L. Russell Brown (music) and was included on the group's 1973 album, \u201cDawn's New Ragtime Follies.\u201d</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cSay, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Nothing like meeting someone and learning about how they got their name and it\u2019s onomatology.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great Fats Domino.  It was written by Dave Bartholomew Antoine Domino (Fats) and released as a single originally on 78rpm in 1953.  Just a classic, wonderful early Rock tune.

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning, Pham!  Happy Sunday!  I hope this blessed day brings you everything you need.  Two years ago to the day I began posting music every day.   By the end of this week it will have been 806 songs.  Every week has had a distinct theme, and I have tried to introduce some not-so-common songs from artists I love others may not be familiar with.  </p>\n<p>However, it is time to take a break.  I have decided to hang it up; I will still be here, just not posting music on a daily basis.  I see people who have a particular \u201cThing\u201d and they stick to it, mine has been music, and I know sometimes when I see someone else do something, I stay away from it so as not to intrude too much; nobody like a copycat.  Time to not be so selfish.  I still have enough material for a few more years\u2019 worth, but I need a break.  I hope you have enjoyed it.  </p>\n<p>No worries about the music, as there are others who post a lot, especially <a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/lolag82\">@lolag82</a>.  She does a great theme every week.  And everyone else here, please post the songs you love.  Music has been such a large part of my sanity for my entire life, I love to listening to what you like.  It has been a lot of fun for me and an absolute pleasure to have done this.</p>\n<p>Anyway\u2026..This final theme is a fun one, it is all about women named ROSE.  A name I have loved since I first heard it.  The name Rose is girl's name of Latin origin meaning \"rose, a flower.\"  Rose is derived from the Latin rosa, which referred to the flower. There is also evidence to suggest it was a Norman variation of the Germanic name Hrodohaidis, meaning \u201cfamous type,\u201d and also Hros, \"horse\". In Old English it was translated as Roese and Rohese. </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great Neil Diamond.  He wrote and recorded this song in 1970 and released it on his album \u201cTap Root Manuscript,\u201d which came out that same year.  It was his first number 1 hit.  Interestingly, the single version of this song was recorded in Mono, while the album version was in Stereo.  \u201cThe stories about how Diamond was inspired to write the song are apocryphal. \"Crackling Ros\u00e9\" is the name of an inexpensive sparkling wine once produced by Andres Wines of British Columbia, Canada, which was popular among the indigenous population. One story suggests that Diamond heard a story about a native Canadian tribe while doing an interview in Toronto, Canada\u2014the tribe had more men than women, so the lonely men of the tribe would sit around the fire and drink their wine together\u2014which inspired him to write the song.\u201d (Jackson, Laura (2005). Neil Diamond: His Life, His Music, His Passion)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cCracklin\u2019 Rosie\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Once I was fishing in Canada, in the middle of a large lake, miles from any shoreline.  A thunderstorm came through, as they usually do, and we were in a pickle.  You see, when the storms come they bring rain, which is not a big deal, but they also bring lightning, which is.  And if you are the tallest thing around, and in an aluminum boat, you become a target.  So, when this happens you get to shore as fast as you can so you don\u2019t get cooked.  Well, as we were going to shore it got pretty bad, there was lightning, and we were a bit scared.  But then, amazingly, the storm broke and out popped, you guessed it, a rainbow.  But it wasn\u2019t just one, it was FOUR.  And I can truly say I have seen the end of a rainbow, as it, literally was in our boat.  It started 3 feet in front of me.  And yeah, there is no Irish midget and a pot of gold.  But it was pretty cool.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the King, Elvis Presley.  This song was when he was truly King.  Written by Fred Wise and Ben Weisman, it was released in 1960 on his soundtrack album, \u201cG.I. Blues.\u201d  You just have to respect the talent on this one.</p>\n<p>hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cPocketful of Rainbows\u201d</p> </div>\n",

You need people in your life who help you get to the places you want to go.  And sometimes, you don\u2019t even know you need to go there, but out of love, they help.  Trying to get you someplace you need top go without you knowing it is hard to disseminate from others trying to control you.  If you ever find this in your life, ask yourself, \u201cAre they doing it for you, or themselves?\u201d</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Beatles.  Yep, you knew this tune was coming, so here it is.  Written by Paul McCartney, and credited to the Mcartney-Lennon team, it was released in 1969 as a single and then in 1970 on their album, \u201cLet it Be.\u201d  It is about the racial prejudices against migrants in London, at the time.  </p>\n<p>hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cGet Back\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Getting back to things sometimes means you lost it in the first place.  Trying to get something back is a tough, stressful thing.  You finally realize you messed up, and now it is time to beg for forgiveness and try to make amends.  Many times I have thought I needed something back, and it was the best thing to have it not be so.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a staple of Yacht Rock Radio on XM Satellite Radio, the band is Player.  It was released in 1977 as the lead single to their self-titled debut album.  Written by Peter Beckett and J.C. Crowley, it hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978.  It was written after two of the band members had just broken up with their girlfriends.  Smooth and awesome, you get the album version of this goodness, the single was cut down for airplay.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cBaby Come Back\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Often our memories and familiar things can do us more harm than good.  I suppose it might be because too many people had a jacked-up childhood; not one of love and compassion, but one of pain and suffering.  When this happens we can get sucked into the abyss of depression or anxiety.  Instead of working on ourselves to get better, it just brings us down.  If this ever happens, time to find a new place to get better.  Remember there was a time, before all of the \u201cBad\u201d stuff happened, where you were wonderful and perfect.  Even if nobody else saw it.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Amy Winehouse.  Written by her and released on her 2006 album of the same name, it was her third single from that album.  This song \u201cis a bleak, grief-stricken portrait of heartbreak purportedly inspired by Winehouse\u2019s ex-boyfriend\u2019s infidelity.\u201d (Charles Waring, Discover Music, 2022)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cBack to Black\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Now, keep in mind Adidas is a German company, and the execs were all very tall, Aryan white dudes, at a Brooklyn concert of Run DMC.

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning, Pham!  Happy Sunday!  I hope this blessed day brings you all you need.  This week is all about FOOTWEAR.  I know, a bit odd of a theme, but I was struck by several songs in my head about it, so here you go.  I used to wear sneakers as a kid, everywhere, although they were known as tennis shoes, back then.  You really only had a few choices, and they Chuck Taylors or Nike\u2019s.  You would wear them out just going form place to place.  Things were different way back when; you didn\u2019t really have all of the fashion choices or want to keep them clean, and they certainly didn\u2019t cost what they do now.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Blues artist Tommy Tucker.  It was written by him (Robert Higginbotham) in 1963 and released as a single.  Such a fun little tune, it combines two very unique styles of footwear.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cHi-Heeled Sneakers\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As we finish off the theme on TOUGH remember things are always tough, and there will be good days and bad ones.  Our ancestors did a whole lot without any of the things we think we can\u2019t live without.  You know, plumbing, electricity, cars, internet, cell phones.  No matter what comes, if we have the right mindset we can get through anything.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a favorite band of mine, the Rock band Tesla.   This is kind of a corny song, but it really has a great message, something most rock songs lack.  This song was written  Jeff Keith, Tommy Skeoch, Frank Hannon and Brian Wheat.  It was their second single form their second album, The Great Radio Controversy,\u201d released in 1989.  When I hit a rough patch in college, this album, and song in particular, helped me out.  Just keep moving forward\u2026.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cHang Tough\u201d</p> </div>\n",

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning, Pham!  Happy Phriday!  I hope your week was a good one!  Being tough can be tough.  It boxes you in to a stereotype and it never lets down.  Too many people think in order to be tough you need to exhibit certain traits.  Mainly being an asshole, being cocky, or just hardcore in whatever you are doing.  But I am here to tell you, those are the weakest people you will ever meet.  The real tough ones are the quiet ones.  The loud mouths and show offs are just that, they pose o real threat, but the quiet ones, they are dangerous.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the band REO Speedwagon.  In 1981, EVERYONE had two albums, AC/DC Back in Black, and REO\u2019s Hi Infidelity.  They were both THAT good. This song was written by lead singer Kevin Cronin and is about how some girls like the nice guys, who treat them with respect.  It has a great intro from the Spanky\u2019s \u201cOur Gang\u201d tv show.  To let you know how big this album was, this song was one of two on the album that got airplay on the radio WITHOUT even being released as a single; the DJ\u2019s just started playing it.   </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cTough Guys\u201d</p> </div>\n",

I think when things do hit the fan, a lot of people will die.  We have had it far to easy for too many generations.  We really don\u2019t know what REAL hardship is.  Given this is a bit of a downer, a fun, lighter tune for today.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from The soothing sounds of Billy Ocean.  The song was written by Billy, Wayne Brathwaite, Barry Eastmond and  Mutt Lange (the Mutt who married, cheated on, and left Shania Twain, yeah, go figure).  This song appeared on two albums, Billy\u2019s \u201cLove Zone,\u201d and the Soundtrack to the movie \u201cThe Jewel of the Nile,\u201d both released in 1985.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Most of us are not, though.  If you ever thought you really were, there was always somebody tougher than you.  But it is a trait among men to be so, and we do it all too well, or not well at all, depending on how you look at it.  But we really think we are, so there you go.  Perception is reality, right up until it isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Beastie Boys.  Yes, quite a shift form yesterday.  This song is back to the Beastie\u2019s roots of being a PUNK band.  It was written by them and Avery Smith and released on their 1994 album, \u201cIll Communication.\u201d  This song is about hating someone in particular\u2014<br>\n\" \u201cBill Laimbeer, motherfucker, it\u2019s time for you to die\u201d<br/>\nThe B-Boys love them some b-ball, and you can hear it in a nice chunk of their lyrics over the course of the group\u2019s career. \u201cTough Guy\u201d is literally calling out ex-Detroit Piston bad boy power forward Bill Laimbeer for being a world class douche on the court. You really can\u2019t blame the guy though, that was back when people actually played defense in the NBA, and you didn\u2019t allow anybody to just walk across the lane for a lay-up or dunk. Ahhh, the good ol\u2019 days\u2026.\u201d (Chris Meyer, Live for Live Music, 2016.)</br></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cTough Guy\u201d</p> </div>\n",

And in very different ways.  Men are all bravado, strength, speed and brutality.  Women are more mentally and emotionally tough.  I know that sounds like an oxymoron, but the amount of crap they deal with is pretty amazing.  Now, I personally believe they bring a lot of it on themselves, but then again, I am thinking like a man, and we look at things in a fairly simple way.  The only thing I KNOW about women is I don\u2019t know ANYTHING about women.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the incomparable Etta James.  It was written by her and Joe Josea.

Look at relationships, politics, etc.  We get screwed every day.  I learned a long time ago you have to do the best you can with what you have.  Don\u2019t be mean or stupid, but honest and loving.  Sometimes other people do not agree, but that is okay. If you really, honestly, try, and give it your all, then whatever the outcome, you are winning.  Now, if you do not really try, then you need to go take that up with the person in the mirror and figure that out.  Remember the four letters that will get you through life\u2026. F\u2026.U\u2026K\u2026 and M.  You do the best you can, if it isn\u2019t good enough for somebody else, then f^ck \u2018em.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great British band Bad Company.

Disco was king and other genres were fairing better on all of the charts.

Sometimes when we do, it upsets the apple cart, so to speak.  Taking action can often be scary, as we are never quite sure of the consequences it will create.  But when we do, we either realize we screwed up or that we did good.  Both are lessons.  The finality of decisions, either way they go, leads us onward.  Don\u2019t be afraid to make decisions, you can always correct your course if need be.  There is freedom in making our choices.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from arguably the greatest American rock band ever, The Eagles.  The song was written by Jack Tempchin and Robb Strandlund and released on The Eagles 1974 album, \u201cOn the Border.\"  It has been one of their most enduring songs, and always played at their live shows.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cAlready Gone\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As we look at trying to get along and figure out our place on this rock, we sometimes get stuck.  Not knowing what to do or how to get there is all too common.  We try to hedge our bets the best we can, but often, we just need to get up and start doing something.  Stop procrastinating and get up and go.  If you are stuck, just start doing something, whatever you are dealing with will come in to focus.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the world of Reggae.

Sometimes it is in the right direction, sometimes the wrong one.  So this week\u2019s theme is GOING, GOING, GONE.  I wonder where we are going, especially given the current political and social climate.  It seems we are headed off a cliff.  I know this really isn\u2019t the case, things have been worse, and they will get better.  But I do wonder what in the heck we are doing.  The amount of stupidity we put up with from our elected officials is astounding.  We can blame them all we want, but we really need to start looking in the mirror.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Violent Femmes.  Written by Gordon Cano, this track was the first single from their debut, eponymous album, released in 1983.  \u201cThe lyrics borrow a complete verse from Willie Dixon's 1954 song \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\" (originally recorded by Muddy Waters).\u201d  Wiki.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cGone Daddy Gone\u201d</p> </div>\n",

I hope your weekend allows you to recharge and maybe relax a little.  As I conclude the theme on BROTHERS, there are so many things you end up going through with them.  You share the joys and pains of growing up together, you fight along side them, with them and around them.  You play sports, you pick on each other, you get in trouble with them.  You share each other\u2019s successes and failures.  You hate them and you love them.  I do not know where I might have landed if it weren\u2019t for them.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the band Dire Straits.  It is the final track on their 1985 album of the same name.  And an AMAZING album it is, my favorite of theirs.  It was written by Mark Knopfler in 1982 about Britain\u2019s involvement in the Falklands War.  A bit somber, but wonderful.  It is about a soldier who is dying on the battlefield, surrounded by his comrades, who remain by his side as he slips away.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cBrothers in Arms\u201d</p> </div>\n",

I learned a lot from each of them, because my oldest brother is more like my mom, and my middle brother is like my dad.  I am pretty much a mix.  I watched my oldest brother and my mother fight like cats and dogs, and my middle brother and my father do the same.  It was interesting.  All get along great now, but it is amazing how  the family dynamics play out.  I learned exactly how to NOT piss off my parents by watching them.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great soul band The Isley Brothers.

After he left, I was upset, naturally.  I couldn\u2019t BELIEVE this P.O.S. said that to me.  Not even an apology for all of the stuff he put me through.  Beating me, giving me a concussion, tying me up and hanging me in a closet\u2026..I could go on and on.  At this time I was 19, he was 25; we could have gotten into a major scrap at that age.  It would not have been pretty; and I thought about it.  Later though, in my anger and disbelief, I had an epiphany.  It hit me right between the eyes and I will NEVER forget  it.  I realized that was the best thing he ever could have said to me.  In that instant he made me understand that the feelings of low self-esteem or poor self-image or whatever were MINE.  They weren\u2019t his.  It was my fault they were there.  I let them in and take over.  I allowed these episodes to affect me, and I laid the blame on him.  He may have done some tough things, he definitely wasn\u2019t nice at times, but so what?  I learned that I was solely responsible for how I felt and how I let things affect me.  I had blamed him for all sorts of things when I should have taken the responsibility myself.  Not for what he did, but how I reacted.  He did do some horrific stuff, and it was unfair, and I didn\u2019t deserve it (well, some of it, anyway).<br>\nI forgave him that day.  We have been good ever since, and never had another issue.  He taught me an important lesson of life, even though he wasn\u2019t even aware he was doing so.  My feelings are my responsibility.  It doesn\u2019t matter what anyone says or does to you, it is how you react that makes it yours.  You can make the outcome good or bad, no matter the action taken against you.  Things happen, Get Over It.  Make the best of it you can and keep moving forward.  Leave all the crap in the past back there and don\u2019t drag it with you; it only slows you down.  I will never forget this lesson, and forever grateful I learned it from him.</br></p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great Neil Diamond.  The song was written by him and was the title track to his 1969 album of the same name.  The song is about an evangelical preacher traveling from town to town preaching as he goes.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cBrother Love's Travelling Salvation Show\u201d</p> </div>\n",

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning, Pham!  Happy Wednesday!  I hope this day brings you all you need.  As we continue on our theme of BROTHERS, I want to share a profound moment in my life with you.  From as far back as I can remember, my oldest brother beat the crap out of me.  My first real memory is crying in a hallway because he hit me, I must have been about 2 or 3.  There is a picture of me as a toddler with a black eye.  He usually hit me in the arms, and they were always bruised.  He beat the ever-livin\u2019 sh&amp;T out of me until I was about 10 or 11.  Just because he could, I guess.  He wasn\u2019t an abusive brother, just a normal one.  But he made me feel so small, so vulnerable.  I couldn\u2019t fight back that well, he was just bigger and stronger.  Now, before you think he was just plain horrible; I wasn\u2019t innocent in all of this, I deserved a good portion of what I got.  After all, we were brothers.  I actually knocked him out cold once when I was about 7 or 8 with a piece of wood.  (Best day of my life up to that point!)<br/>\nAs you can imagine I was a little affected by all of this.  So much so it caused some low self-esteem issues, self-doubts and general poor self-image.  When I was in college there was a big push to find your inner child, go back and deal with all of the things that happened to you and try to remember that innocent little child you left behind.  How you didn\u2019t deserve the bad things that happened, etc.  So I went to counselling and let it all out.  It was really awkward and very odd; it really didn\u2019t help much.  (In hindsight, it was all a load of crap.  The lesson I learned was the exact opposite of what they were telling me).  But part of it was about confronting the things you felt wronged you and try to make them right, so I did.  Later that year, when I was back from school my brother came by and we had it out.  I told him about all of the stuff he did and how wrong it was and we got into it.  How it affected me and how I felt about it.  I was expecting an apology.  He looked me dead in the eye and told me \u201cGet over it.\u201d  I was outraged.  We fought and he left.<br/>\nPart 2 tomorrow\u2026.. </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the band The Stories.  The song was written by Errol Brown and Tony Wilson of the group Hot Chocolate, who released it in 1973.  It is a much more, funky version, but not as well known.  The Stories recorded it and released it also in 1973 where it reached number 1 on the Billboard Singles Chart.  The song is about an interracial love affair between a white man and a black woman, and the subsequent disowning of the man by his parents because of it.  Here is the extended version.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cBrother Louie\u201d</p> </div>\n",

They can beat the crap out of you one moment and then come to your aid a few minutes later.  You can fight and argue all day and then suddenly you are inseparable friends.  I don\u2019t know why this happens, but it does.  No matter how much you can\u2019t get a long, when the time comes, you are there for each other.  Too many times in my life I have learned lessons from both of my brothers this way, and a lot of them were painful, but we always came together when needed.    </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the British band The Hollies.  The song was written by Bobby Scott and Bob Russel.  It was originally released by Kelly Gordon in 1969 and also Neil Diamond in 1970.  The Hollie\u2019s version was  also released in 1970 as a single and then as the title track to their album, that year.  The title comes from an 1884 book, \u201cThe Parables of Jesus.\u201d  The phrase was later picked up by Father Edward Flanagan as he founded the Boys Town organization in 1941.  \u201cIn 1938, Spencer Tracey portrayed Father Flanagan in the movie Boys Town, which also starred Mickey Rooney. In 1941, they made a sequel called Men Of Boys Town, where they used the phrase \"He ain't heavy, Father, he's my brother\" for the first time in a movie.:\u201d (songfacts) </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cHe Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Brother\u201d</p> </div>\n",

I hope your weekend allows you to recharge and maybe relax a little.  As we finish off our theme on HOT, the dog days of summer are truly here.  We have seen a lot of days over 100 degrees and there doesn\u2019t look like there is any relief in sight, until Fall.  That is the price for living farther south, but I will pay it.  I would rather sweat from the heat than freeze while shoveling snow.  Even though you can literally cook outside with no grill.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is one to get your blood boiling.  It is from the Rock band Van Halen.  The song was written by the brothers, Edward and Alex Van Halen.  It was released on their self-titled debut album in 1978.  It is about just being a rock and roll superstar.  Nothing like starting off your weekend to this.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cOn Fire\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Continuing on with yesterday\u2019s ramblings about feeling like you are the best thing since nickel beer and sliced bread, sometimes you are just that cool, right up until you aren\u2019t.  Nothing like reality and getting in the way of a good time.  One minute you can\u2019t be beat, then everything changes.  Especially when you are talking to girls.  You say one wrong thing and BAM, down for the count you go.  If I could count the number of times I have been shot down by girls in my life there would be a war memorial.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Country fun guy Jerry Reed.  The song was written by him and released on his 1971 album, for which his track was the title track.  This is just a fun little song, all about how an illegal crap game goes wrong.

It is a bit hard to explain, but there are times in your life when you just feel \u201cOn.\u201d  You just feel like you are really hot sh%t, nothing can go wrong, you are the coolest person in the room, etc.  Everything you do just turns to gold.  It\u2019s just easier to feel that way when you don\u2019t have to wear an overcoat or put on thick boots.  It is also easier to pick up girls when you don\u2019t have 13 layers of clothes on and you look like something out of an arctic expedition.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Canadian Rock band Loverboy.  This song was released as a single form their debut eponymous album, \u201cLoverboy\u201d in 1981.  It was written by Paul Dean and Bernie Aubin.  It is supposedly about then up and coming rock star Bryan Adams.  Who know s if it is true, but it is a fun song, nonetheless.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Kid is Hot Tonight\u201d</p> </div>\n",

I honestly think where the weather is warmer the people are nicer, overall.  When it is too cold, you just feel miserable, and everything seems a lot harder to accomplish.  At least in the heat I can cool down with one of the greatest inventions ever, A/C.

It has been really hot here in Texas, lately.  We have been lucky the past few summers, it hasn\u2019t gotten too hot, but this year, since the first day of summer we have had 15 of 25 days over 100 degrees (that\u2019s over 38 degrees Celsius for all you who don\u2019t speak American).

I frequently look at the problems in life and try to figure out what went wrong.  Was it me?  Was it them?   Was it something else?  A lot of the time I find it comes down to a simple misunderstanding of what the other person wants o the situation as a whole.

All cultures, peoples, traces, creeds.  It is where our strength lies.  We can take the best form everywhere and somehow make it our own.  Until recently, that is.  Over the past 50 years  or so we have allowed too much division to take the place of our willingness to get along.  Too many groups, especially small groups, representing minority opinions, have driven wedges between all of us trying to gain power.  You see it every day with the leftist element trying to burn down everything abut our beautiful country.  It is amazing the hypocrisy involve din hating the very thing that allows you to function.  Eventually it will come to a head, and they will be shown the door.

I realize we are never truly free, we all have obligations, but we get a glimpse of what it means to be truly free sometimes.  When we have a day off, when we have a little extra money and get to buy whatever we want, or when we just completely stop caring about a particular thing.  It allows us to know what it means to have the choice of what to do, ourselves.  Many a work of art is about being truly free, to know what we can do when we cut loose the bonds of all that binds us in this world and truly live.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the first real super group of Rock \u2018n Roll, Cream.

As we get to the FREEDOM part of this week\u2019s theme, I wonder if people know hat it means to be free.  What does it really mean?  Today I think people don\u2019t want freedom, they want security.  It is human nature to want others to take care of us.  It is easier.  To be truly free is scary, and hard.  To depend on nothing but God and oneself to make things happen.  We have lost the concept of freedom in America, too many want \u201cThe Government\u201d to provide for them, and shirk personal responsibility in the process.  We see a multitude of things in the media, both traditional and social, telling us we just need to listen to some other bureaucratic  authority, who will restrict our freedoms for  what they want to provide for us.

I hope you have friends and family around, maybe have a cookout, watch a ball game, crack open a beer, or just relax and enjoy our precious freedom.  Please remember how we got here, and possibly think about what we need to do to keep it.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Francis Scott Key and John Stafford Smith.  Wiki has the best description of this, so here it is.  \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" is the national anthem of the United States. The lyrics come from the \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\",[2] a poem written on September 14, 1814, by 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships of the Royal Navy in Baltimore Harbor during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. Key was inspired by the large U.S. flag, with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory. </p>\n<p>The poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a men's social club in London. \"To Anacreon in Heaven\" (or \"The Anacreontic Song\" ), with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States. This setting, renamed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", soon became a well-known U.S. patriotic song. With a range of 19 semitones, it is known for being very difficult to sing. Although the poem has four stanzas, only the first is commonly sung today.<br/>\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was recognized for official use by the United States Navy in 1889, and by U.S. president Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931 (46 Stat. 1508, codified at 36 U.S.C. \u00a7 301), which was signed by President Herbert Hoover. </p>\n<p>Before 1931, other songs served as the hymns of U.S. officialdom. \"Hail, Columbia\" served this purpose at official functions for most of the 19th century. \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\", whose melody is identical to \"God Save the Queen\", the United Kingdom's national anthem, also served as a de facto national anthem.  Following the War of 1812 and subsequent U.S. wars, other songs emerged to compete for popularity at public events, among them \"America the Beautiful\", which itself was being considered before 1931 as a candidate to become the national anthem of the United States\u201d</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cStar Spangled Banner as You\u2019ve Never Heard It\u201d</p> </div>\n",

The Flyers brought Smith in to perform live before Game 6 of the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals on May 19, 1974, and the Flyers won the Cup that day.\u201d  (wiki)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cGod Bless America\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Bobby Mercer then rewrote the lyrics in English.  Wayne Newton first released it but the version we all know is from 1966.

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning, Pham!  Happy Thursday!  I hope this week is going well for you.  As we continue our theme on SUMMER, there were times we would spend our time cruising when I was a teen.  For those of you not old enough to remember, we didn\u2019t have computers, or cell phones, or internet; we had each other.  On a Friday or Saturday night there was \u201cThe Strip,\u201d and every town had one.  It was a section of road, usually with restaurants, bars, all along both sides and we would just get some friends, hopefully a cool car, and just cruise up and down.  You would then find your \u201cCrowd\u201d and hang out.  We drank beer, drag raced and tried to pick up girls.  Yes, occasionally some fights would break out, as they always do when young, teenage boys are around.  And yes, it usually involved a girl, a rival or school pride.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Punk Rocker Billy Idol.  But this song is not Punk, it is amazing.  Written by him and released in 1982 on his debut solo album \u201cBilly Idol.\u201d  With Billy\u2019s punk roots, which run deep, one might never expect such a classic, almost early rock type of song.  Well written, great lyrics and very refreshing, especially for 1982.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cHot in the City\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Sometimes it was hot and punishing, sometimes it was beautiful and calming, and sometimes you just had a great time relaxing.  Make sure you make some time to just chill and do nothing this summer.  You need it, your mind needs it, your soul needs it.  This song may help.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great funk/soul band War.  The song was written by the band, and released on the first day of summer in 1976 on their Greatest Hits album.  The single had it as the A side, and the B side was \"All Day Music.\"  That was a hell of a single to have.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cSummer\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Everybody piled in the station wagon (the one with the tail-gunner third-row seats) and for two weeks, we would drive to several places and just see the sights.  We would camp, go to see the Smithsonian, drive all over the place.  It was wonderful.  As young people do, I am sure we complained a lot, but those memories are now very fond. </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the man with a velvet voice, Nat King Cole.  The song was written by Hans Carste, and originally written in German as \u201cDu spielst \u2018ne tolle Rolle,\u201d with lyrics by Hans Bradtke and released under that title by Willy Hagara in 1962.  (wiki)  But then Nat King Cole got a hold of it and in 1963 released a version with lyrics by Charles Tobias.

During the summertime a lot of us had jobs when we were younger.,  This seems to have disappeared as of late, but it was always something we did in my day.  You either worked at a grocery store, a restaurant, worked outside cutting grass or a myriad of other \u201cTeenage\u201d jobs.  It was a great time, it taught us responsibility, gave us some cash to spend, and prepared us for life.  So many lessons I learned as a youngster working.  It seems now all of the young people go out and protest.  I wonder what they are learning?</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great early rocker Eddie Cochran.  The song was written by him and his manager, Jerry Capehart.  It was released as a single in 1958.  It is a typical teenage angst song about problems between himself and authority.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cSummertime Blues\u201d</p> </div>\n",

SO we will have our theme on all things SUMMER&gt;  I loved summer as a kid, no school, playing outside all day, playing tennis, being at the pool, cookouts, all the things that made everything worth it in life.  As we grow older we get jobs and responsibility, so summertime is just like every other season o f  the year, just hotter.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great Jeff Lynn and his band Electric Light Orchestra.  This song was written by Jeff and released in 1978 on ELO\u2019s seventh studio album \u201cOut of the Blue.\u201d  Jeff is the closest thing we have to another Beatle, and his song writing and performances are amazing.  I saw him a few years ago with my daughter and he was amazing.  Even my daughter was impressed.  Here is the same lineup I saw, live.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Blue Sky\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As we finish off our them on FATHERS I remember my father when he would cuss.  It was definitely different, there were the \u201cnot-so-bad\u201d words used at home when my brothers and me screwed up, and there was the different words used when he was at work and somebody screwed up.  Boy, the first time I ever heard my dad drop the F-bomb was and eye-opening experience.  He never used foul language all that much, more of a fire-for-effect kind of usage, but when he did, you knew he meant business.  Playtime was over, time to buckle down and do whatever needed to be done.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the amazing Gladys Knight and The Pips.

I can only say I have ever seen my father cry when his parents passed.  He is just that way.  Life happens, crying won\u2019t help any and you just have to keep moving forward.  The emotions and feelings don\u2019t ever fix anything themselves, you have to do something to change.  That\u2019s how he looks at things, just get up and get busy.   He is not a cold man, but warm and loving, just not very emotional, except when he was angry at us, and, by the way, we deserved every bit of it.    </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Blues singer Bobby Blue Bland.

I loved learning from him, about all sorts of things, but I HATED being taught.  There was always something that had to be done, a chore, or an event or work.  It was just miserable sometimes.  But I know now he did it for a reason, and I have never regretted it.  He taught my brothers and me to be self-reliant, that we may not be the strongest, or the smartest, but no one will ever out work us.  He taught me, what I try to teach my kids, that no matter what the problem is, you can figure it out.  You may fail, you may have to get help, but if you persevere, you will figure it out.  I love that man.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a Soul classic from the Chi-Lites.  This Chicago band blended amazing harmonies and style and is a staple of early 70\u2019s Soul Music.

We bonded through working, either fixing something broken (and between me and my two brothers, we broke EVERYTHING), making something better, or just learning about business through him.

As we finish off our them on AIRPLANES I hope everyone understands just what a marvel of technology they are.  To be able to get into a machine, then hours later be 1000\u2019s of miles away is nothing short of science fiction.  It was magic until about a 120 years ago.  Something only our ancestors dreamed of.  What a great time to be alive!</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the amazing Nat King Cole.  This song was written by him and Irving Mills in 1943.  It was released as a single.  A little history\u2014\u201cThe song was based on a black folk tale that Cole's father had used as a theme for one of his sermons.  In the tale, a buzzard takes different animals for a joy ride. When he gets hungry, he throws them off on a dive and eats them for dinner.  A monkey who had observed this trick goes for a ride; he wraps his tail around the buzzard's neck and gives the buzzard a big surprise by nearly choking him to death.\u201d</p>\n<p>Also worthy of note for any musical aficionado\u2019s\u2014He recorded today\u2019s track, along with \u201cGee Baby Ain\u2019t I Good to You, \"If You Can\u2019t Smile and Say Yes,\" and \"Jumpin' at Capitol\" in one, 3-hour recording session.  (Both tidbits from Jim Cogan and William Clark\u2019s book, Temples of Sound: Inside the Great Recording Studios).</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cStraighten Up and Fly Right\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As we continue our theme on being AIRPLANES I am fascinated by military aircraft.  Growing up around aviation, there was always a movie about WWII with the P51, or F4U Corsair, or the B17 or a myriad of other planes on.  Just watching those movies and marveling at how the pilots faced their challenges was amazing to me.  Then there were the airshows.  Getting close to those planes.  What a joy!  The true grit and will to survive, all encompassed in a machine made of wood, fabric and metal.  Those amazing men in their flying machines.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a novelty song from the band The Royal Guardsman.  It was written by Phil Gernhard and Dick Holler and recorded in 1966 for the album \u201cSnoopy and his Friends.\u201d   Fun one for your week.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cSnoopy vs. The Red Baron\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As we continue on our theme of Airplanes, there is something about taking trips, going to the airport and saying goodbye to the ones you love.  Something about getting ready leave and never knowing, for sure, if you will ever see them again.  I know it is a bit morbid, but tomorrow is never guaranteed.  Call the ones you love.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the hippie group Peter, Paul and Mary.  Originally written and recorded by singer-songwriter John Denver[1] in 1966, entitled, \"Babe I Hate To Go\".

The flight was fine, only a few hours, nothing like the Chicago to Hong Kong run (16 hours).  It just reminded me of my father talking about how flight USED to be, everyone dressed up, the service was great, the people were nice.  I was a special event.  Now it is just another thing, sitting next to people with no manners who think it is their own living room.  Sad.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the wonderful, Steve Miller Band.

This week, and the next three, for that matter, are going to be nuts for me.  A lot of things going on at work.  A very busy time where we have too much to do, not enough time, unrealistic expectations, bad management, not enough resources and not enough people.  Typical, I know, and not something one can really complain about, but this time it is true.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the amazing band, Queen.  Released in 1974 on their album \u201cSheer Heart Attack,\u201d this song was written by Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon.  Possibly the first Thrash or Speed Metal song ever, it is truly amazing considering when it was released.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cStone Cold Crazy\u201d</p> </div>\n",

The next few weeks for me will be extremely busy, work is going nuts and everyone there is just at their wits end.  So, this week we are going to have songs about being CRAZY.  We are going to start off a little weird, go hard in the middle, and then settle down at the end of the week.

Yes, I want my team to win, or to win the lottery, or to meet someone nice, or \u2026..  but those all seem way to selfish.  I find Prayer to be more personal, and more of a way to ask for the things that matter in my life.  Health and safety of my family, my Phamily, my coworkers, our leaders, and those suffering.  I ask for everyone to see the miracles around us, and for those in pain to find theirs.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Soul group from Baltimore, The Royalettes.

This is where MIRACLES come in.  We see something that just can\u2019t be true, but it is.  It shakes our faith and our reality in such a way that we have to rethink how we live and how we see things.  The last 500 years or so, modern society has done its best to ride the world of miracles, and even the concept of miracles.  You see this throughout literature and science, everything can be explained through science and reason.  Well folks, if that were the case we would be in a better state, but we aren\u2019t.  Science and reason are wonderful gifts from God, but they can\u2019t fix everything.  </p>\n<p>\"There are two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle.

As we continue our them on PRAYER, I hope you have something in your life that brings you peace, helps you to control the anxieties of life and can calm your soul.  Lately, after tragedies prayer is openly mocked by the left as doing no good.   They have no concept of what prayer is about, mainly because their religion is the State and themselves.  Their belief is not in God, or even in humanity, but in tyranny and the thought they are smarter than everyone else and need to control all of us to make them feel secure.  There is no safety in this world, except what you can create on your own.  A lot of people have a hard time with this concept., fully expecting the government (whomever that might be) to protect them and keep them from harm and take care of them.  The State can\u2019t save you, only you can, and we need all the help we can get, e.g. prayer.</p>\n<p>\"Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure.

The events of the past week drive home a fact we are in a mental health crisis in this country.  No surprise, I know, but everything we are seeing, the transgender crap, the gun violence, the rampant corruption and graft, the breakdown of the family, and many more are not problems, but symptoms of the last 50 years of leftist garbage in our society.  When politicians started removing everything moral about humanity back in the 60\u2019s, taking God out of schools, fathers out of families via welfare, legally allowing people and companies to abdicate personal responsibility with laws, codifying corporate greed and government overreach with our judicial system, hatred of our own country, open borders; and on and on and on\u2026..  It has been a disaster.   The current situation is not tenable, it will lead to our destruction.  Maybe not today or tomorrow, but eventually.  We have a morally bankrupt set of leaders in all walks of life.  We need to make changes in order to survive.</p>\n<p>With that being said, I will get off of my stump and introduce this week\u2019s theme.  It is about PRAYER and MIRACLES.  I know not everyone is a believer, and that is fine, but this helps me, and it I hope it helps you.  If this is not something you are interested in, then by all means, move on to the next post, no judgement here.  We need prayer for ourselves, our friends and families, our leaders and even our enemies to make a better world.  We need this to see the miracles which abound on this planet from the grace afforded us to the sheer wonders of God, humanity and nature.   </p>\n<p>\u201cLord, may everything we do begin with your inspiration, continue with your help, and reach perfection under your guidance . . \u201c \u2013Opening Prayer, Mass Thursday after Ash Wednesday.

One of my favorite birds, Foghorn Leghorn, in all his glory ( I stick to the original version, as all the others are just crap).  He is a character, voiced be the great Mel Blanc, who appeared in 29 Looney Toons and Merrie Melodies cartoons from 1946 to 1964.  The character was inspired by a fictional character on the Fred Allen Show, a southern Senator, Beauregard Claghorn.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Foghorn Leghorn Compilation.</p> </div>\n",

You are in the middle of civilization, with cars and traffic everywhere, not too much nature around, and there is a sh%t load of birds hanging out.  I don\u2019t get it.

This week\u2019s theme will be about MOTHERS!  Of the greatest things this world has ever created, it is the love of a mother.  The bond created is simply divine.  As there is nothing a mother won\u2019t do for her child, there is nothing they wouldn\u2019t do for their mother.  </p>\n<p>The young mother set her foot on the path of life. \"Is this the long way?\" she asked.<br>\nAnd the guide said: \"Yes, and the way is hard. And you will be old before you reach the end of it. But the end will be better than the beginning.\"<br/>\nBut the young mother was happy, and she would not believe that anything could be better than these years. So she played with her children, and gathered flowers for them along the way, and bathed them in the clear streams; and the sun shone on them, and the young mother cried, \"Nothing will ever be lovelier than this.\"<br/>\nThen the night came, and the storm, and the path was dark, and the children shook with fear and cold, and the mother drew them close and covered them with her mantle, and the children said, \"Mother, we are not afraid, for you are near, and no harm can come.\"<br/>\nAnd the morning came, and there was a hill ahead, and the children climbed and grew weary, and the mother was weary. But at all times she said to the children,\" A little patience and we are there.\" So the children climbed, and when they reached the top they said, \"Mother, we would not have done it without you.\"<br/>\nAnd the mother, when she lay down at night looked up at the stars and said, \"This is a better day than the last, for my children have learned fortitude in the face of hardness. Yesterday I gave them courage. Today, I've given them strength.\"<br/>\nAnd the next day came strange clouds which darkened the earth, clouds of war and hate and evil, and the children groped and stumbled, and the mother said: \"Look up. Lift your eyes to the light.\"  And the children looked and saw above the clouds an everlasting glory, and it guided them beyond the darkness. And that night the mother said, \"This is the best day of all, for I have shown my children God.\"<br/>\nAnd the days went on, and the weeks and the months and the years, and the mother grew old and she was little and bent. But her children were tall and strong, and walked with courage. And when the way was rough, they lifted her, for she was as light as a feather; and at last they came to a hill, and beyond they could see a shining road and golden gates flung wide. And mother said, \"I have reached the end of my journey. And now I know the end is better than the beginning, for my children can walk alone, and their children after them.\"<br/>\nAnd the children said, \"You will always walk with us, Mother, even when you have gone through the gates.\" And they stood and watched her as she went on alone, and the gates closed after her. And they said: \"We cannot see her but she is with us still.  A mother like ours is more than a memory. She is a living presence.\"--unknown</br></p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great Paul Simon.  This song was written by him and released in 1972 on his second album, \u201cPaul Simon.\u201d  The title has its origin in a chicken-and-egg dish called \"Mother and Child Reunion\" that Simon saw on a Chinese restaurant's menu.[4] The song's lyrics were inspired by a pet dog that was run over and killed.

The thing about starting a family, especially when the first child arrives, is losing everything you used to do and replacing it with the baby.  Everything changes, every part of your life revolves around the baby.  Finding time to do the normal things can be taxing.  Your whole world now revolves around your children.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust as there is no warning for childbirth, there is no preparation for the sight of a first child. There should be a song for women to sing at this moment or a prayer to recite. But perhaps there is none because there are no words strong enough to name that moment.\u201d\u2014Anita Diamant</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from The great Marvin Gaye.  This song was from the great Motown Studios and written by Norman Whitfield, Barrett Strong, and Janie Bradford.

It is often hard to realize the only way they can express themselves is by crying.  They can\u2019t speak yet, they can\u2019t tell you or explain anything, so they just cry.  It can absolutely wear you down.  There are going to be many sleepless nights and many last nerves worked over the next many months.  It can be the most difficult thing to deal with, but in the end, it is definitely worth it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are places in the heart you don\u2019t even know exist until you love a child.\u201d\u2014Anne Lamott</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Janis Joplin.  This song was written by Bert Berns and Jerry Ragovoy and it was originally recorded by Garnet Mimms and the Enchanters in 1963 on their album of the same name.  Janis released her version in 1970 on her album \u201cPearl.\u201d</p>\n<p>I truly hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cCry Baby\u201c</p> </div>\n",

You have to keep chasing whatever it is to get it better.  The key is to keep moving forward and no matter how many times you fail, just keep trying.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf everybody was satisfied with himself there would be no heroes.\"\u2014Mark Twain</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a Funk band form Brooklyn, New York, BT Express.  Originally it was called Brooklyn Transit Express (my guess is after the band C.T.A, the Chicago Transit Authority, later Chicago).   This song was written by Billy Nichols and was the title track form their album, released in 1974.  A great example of early 70\u2019s Funk music, it has that dirty feel to it.  </p>\n<p>I truly hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cDo It (\u2018Til You\u2019re Satisfied)\u201c</p> </div>\n",

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning, Pham!  Happy Tuesday!  I hope your day is a great one.  Well, after paying our taxes, money seems to be nowhere to be found.  Couple that with the way our leaders are handling inflation, and we are pretty much broke.  You might get a 5% raise, which is great, but inflation is over 8% and climbing, so you actually lose money.  What a deal!  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a favorite of mine, Simply Red. They are a Soul group from Manchester, England, fronted by Mick Hucknall.  This is a great example of modern, Blue-Eyed Soul.  This song was originally written and recorded by John and Billy Valentine in 1982, but was redone by Simply Red in 1984.  It was released on their album Picture Book.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cMoney's Too Tight (to Mention)\u201d</p> </div>\n",

So this week, we talk everything TAXES.  There is something good about paying taxes, in that we get to pay for the service sour government provides, but also some horrible things, like how our said government wastes so much money on crap.  So while I don\u2019t mind the concept, the reality is our leaders piss away our money.  So it sucks to pay the money we do only to watch it go to some politician\u2019s friends or pet projects, or better yet, some other country.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from one of the greats of Country Swing, Hank Penny.  Most of you have probably never heard of him, but from the 1940\u2019s through the 60\u2019s he was kind of a big deal.

Men often wonder about things.  Are minds tend to go every which way.  Women sometimes wonder what men are thinking, and many times, we aren\u2019t.  It\u2019s just static.  Women never believe this, but it is true.  We often have this mind set of trying to be anywhere but where we are right then.  We just get lost, trying to be somewhere else.  </p>\n<p>\"Men go abroad to wonder at the heights of mountains, at the huge waves of the sea, at the long courses of the rivers, at the vast compass of the ocean, at the circular motions of the stars, and they pass by themselves without wondering.\"\u2014St. Augustine of Hippo</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is staying in the South!

One of the many things about women I don\u2019t understand (and come to think of it, there isn\u2019t one thing I DO understand), is how they can rationalize almost anything.  They can do it to their detriment or to their advantage, depending on how they feel.  Too many women sell themselves short, I feel.

It is a love song that Joel wrote for his then wife.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s Always a Woman\u201d</p> </div>\n",

With the dawning of a new week we get to see all the things we pray our future can hold.  Nothing more can be greater than that of a woman.  We, as men, have so much hope for the fairer sex.  We see in you all that is good and pure.  That may be why we want to protect you so much; mainly from the devastation men have wrought on this earth since the beginning of time. It is not that we want to hold you back in any way, it is more we wish to preserve you from evil.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection comes from the Queen of Soul herself, Aretha Franklin.   Written by Gerry Goffin, the amazing Carole King and Jerry Wexler, it was released as a single in 1967.  It also appeared on her album \u201cLady Soul.\u201d  This song is amazing, and pretty much speaks for itself.  It only reached number 8 on the Billboard charts, however.  Odd this great of a song never made it to number 1. </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201c(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As we start our theme, we will tackle the ever-confusing role Science (especially Biology) plays in our lives.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from English artist Thomas Dolby.  This song was written by him and Jo Kerr and then subsequently released in 1982 as a single, then later on his album \u201cThe Golden Age of Wireless.\u201d  This quintessential One Hit Wonder was a staple of my early adolescence.

As we continue on with our theme of trying the Calm the F*** Down, I though tit would be great to sprinkle in, not just a song about being calm, but one that can actually make you relax and BE calm.

One of my favorite operas, and in this piece, Countess Almaviva is telling Susanna to write an invitation to a tryst addressed to the countess' husband in order to catch him cheating on her.</p>\n<p>The song is very repetitive, but the translation is as follows\u2014</p>\n<p>\"Canzonetta sull'aria\"   \"A little song on the breeze\" (the title)<br/>\nChe soave zeffiretto    What a gentle little Zephyr<br/>\nQuesta sera spirer\u00e0  This evening will sigh<br/>\nSotto i pini del boschetto.

The cool thing about the time change happening is we seem to have a better delineation between night and day.  I know it is just an arbitrary movement of a man-made device happening here, but when you have more daylight, the night just seems to fit better in the overall scheme of things.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection comes form the band The Strangeloves.  It was written by Bob Feldman, Jerry Goldstein and Richard Gottehrer, and is from their 1965 album \u201cI Want Candy LP.\u201d  A great song, covered by many, it is just a great song to get ready to go out to.  And the outfits on the album cover, pure GOLD!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cNight Time\u201d</p> </div>\n",

One thing about the time change I find fascinating is the perception of actually having more time to do things.  I know it is just in my head, but the more sunshine we have, the more I feel like I can get things done.  When the sun goes down too early I just kind of crap out and don\u2019t get very much done.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a soul group from Michigan, The Chairmen of the Board.  This song was written by Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, Edward Holland, Jr., and Ron Dunbar (the Motown writing crew).  It was released in 1970 on the album \u201cChairmen of the Board.\u201d  Just a great song to remind you of the gift we have been given, a little more time.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cGive Me Just A Little More Time\u201d</p> </div>\n",

The middle of the work week is here and we are still trying to enjoy our new frame of reference form when the sun comes up and goes down.  It is so nice to be able to see the sun set.  For the past few months it has been hard, as I am usually driving home from work and it is getting dark, or the sun has already set.  Being able to relax a little, and then watch the sun set is a great, relaxing experience.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is another song which started small, but was remade bigly.  The group that made it a hit was The Platters, and it was released as a single in 1958.  It was written by Buck Ram, Morty Nevins, Al Nevins, and Artie Dunn; it was originally recorded and released by Les Brown and his Band of Renown in 1945 as an instrumental.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cTwilight Time\u201d</p> </div>\n",

I really can\u2019t explain it, but it is like something was taken from me, and now it has been given back.</p>\n<p>Today we venture somewhere I bet you never thought I would go, to a New Wave British band, Culture Club.  This song was written by Roy Hay, Boy George, Mikey Craig and Jon Moss.  It weas released on their 1982 album \u201cKissing to be Clever.\u201d  I remember HATING this song when I was younger and it came out.  This was just too weird, but after many years the song started to grow on me.  It is just a great pop song.  Well written and put together.

I will also try to stay off the beaten path this week with the tunes.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from The Kinks.  A fun little song written by Ray Davies in the calypso style and released on their 1970 album \u201cLola Versus Powerman and the Money-go-round, Part One.\u201d  Ray \u201cwrote this song about a man who is unhappy with the modern world. Looking to escape the problems caused by his fellow humans, he plans a journey away from home, where he can live like an \u2018apeman.\u2019\" (songfacts)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cApeman\u201d</p> </div>\n",

I know it is hard out there, and everyone is a little on edge about world events.  Once again things are going to pot.  This week is the beginning of Lent in the Catholic world, a time of repentance and self-reflection, it starts on Ash Wednesday.  So this week I had a few things in mind but decided that we need some uplifting songs to help us out.  I would say it is about hope, but it is more than that, it is about seeing the best even when things don\u2019t look so good.  Fair warning, we are going to be all over the place this week, musically.</p>\n<p>Since it is Sunday, I thought we would have  a little bit of Gospel music.  No worries, as this artist is also the Queen of Rock n\u2019 Roll.  Today\u2019s musical selection is from Sister Rosetta Tharpe.  There is no \u201cWriter\u201d for this song, as it is classified as a Traditional African American Spiritual.  It was made more famous in 1944/1945 when it was recorded and released by Tharpe.  A classic tune to help you see what we are experiencing is as old as time itself.  And Sister Rosetta Tharpe, she is just amazing and one of the founders of Rock music.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cStrange Things Happen Every Day\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As we finish off our theme of lost 80\u2019s songs from my youth, the 1980\u2019s had some great music and some horrible music, just like every other decade.  But whatever decade made you grow up; those are the songs you loved.  They mean something to you.  They are attached to those memories and experiences that defined who you were then, and who you became later.  Even if you changed later in life, for better or worse, those songs will always bring back memories.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Donnie Iris.  You may not know he was in the Jaggerz, who had a 1970 hit with \u201cThe Rapper,\u201d or was in the band Wild Cherry.  But this song was his biggest solo hit.  It was written by him and Mark Avsec and released in 1980 on Iris\u2019s album \u201cBack on the Streets.\u201d  It was really popular in Pittsburgh.  Just a great 80\u2019s song.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cAh!  Leah!\u201d</p> </div>\n",

These early 80\u2019s tunes remind me of how hard it was, and how fun it was to learn about life, love, friendship, and all that goes with being a youth.  Now, I realize these things aren\u2019t specific to any, one, time.  But this time was mine.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection stays in Canada!

Often it was sitting at the lake, or in somebody\u2019s garage, smoking, drinking, fighting, trying to pick up girls and always listening to music.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the second-best Canadian Rock Trio ever, Triumph.

As we cruise through the 80\u2019s there were some great rock tracks, and some interesting ones.  I say interesting because erven though we listened to a lot of rock n\u2019 roll (and pop, and dance, and rap\u2026), there were songs which were a little softer, a little different and just plain cool.  Songs you could have a different vibe to.  This is a cool song to just get into a groove and get things done.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from English musician Russ Ballard.  A prolific songwriter who wrote this song; he had this hit in 1984 on his second, self-titled album.  Russ has written so many songs by artists you love, among them are Santana, Rainbow, Roger Daltrey, Three Dog Night, America, Anni-Frid Lyngstad (ABBA) and others, not to mention founding the group Argent back in the 70\u2019s.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cVoices\u201d</p> </div>\n",

You could be anywhere when they came on, and yes, they came on the radio.  For parties it was usually the radio but sometimes a boom box with a cassette player.  But that kind of took the fun out of it.  There was something special when a song was played over the air, unexpectedly.  It could make your day.  This is one of those songs.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a British heavy metal group, Fastway.  It was made up of ex members of Motorhead and UFO.  The song was written by David R King, Edward Alan Clarke and Jeremy D Shirley, it was released on their self-titled debut album in 1983.  This is just pure 80\u2019s Rock n\u2019 Roll.

As we continue on our theme of Lost 80\u2019s songs there are just some that are \u201cBranded in your brain cells,\u201d (a phrase used by a high school calculus teacher of mine).  For some reason they never go away and are always there.  You may forget from time to time, but suddenly, they just appear and it brings you back to a certain place and time.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from The Planet P Project.  It was the brainchild of musician Tony Carey.  He made very science fiction themed music.  This tune was written by him and released in 1983 on the album \u201cPlanet P Project.\u201d  This song is about being isolated, something I think we all have been in the past few years to some degree.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy Me?\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Last week I noticed a lot of things posted about the 80\u2019s and the 90\u2019s.  My understanding is there were some comments on a lives tream about music and what is good and what is bad.  I usually write my themes out on Saturday mornings, so I missed it last week.  But not to fear!  As a child of the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s we have for your enjoyment some lost classics of the early 80\u2019s for you this week.  These are songs from my early, formative years.  The later 80\u2019s we will revisit sometime in the future, when I thought I knew everything.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a New Orleans band, Zebra.  This son was written by singer Randy Jackson and released on their 1982, self-titled, debut.  This is pure 80\u2019s hard rock, with amazing vocals and just a great rocking attitude.  Many a mile were spent cruising listening to this album.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cTell Me What You Want\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Two years after Kaye Ballard recorded the first commercial version of the song, Johnny Mathis released his rendition as \"Fly Me to the Moon.\"  In 1962 the composer Joe Harnell revived the song, giving it a bossa nova arrangement. His version peaked at <a href=\"/newsfeed?search=14\" style=\"float: none;\">#14</a> in the US and won a Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. Two years later, Frank Sinatra recorded the song with the Count Basie Orchestra arranged by Quincy Jones.

This song was written by her and was released in 1993 on her album \u201cFumbling Towards Ecstasy.\u201d  It is about deranged fans, who had written letters to Sarah.

People who get obsessed with others are simply frightening.  The odd thing is about the insane, is that they see no problem with their behavior.  Which, I guess, can be said by the sane as well.  Even though what they are doing is wrong and obviously crazy, the human mind justifies it.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Blues great Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins.

I hope it is a great day for you!  As we continue our theme on Stalkers, the phenomena is all about obsession.  Merriam-Webster\u2019s dictionary defines it as \u201ca state in which someone thinks about someone or something constantly or frequently especially in a way that is not normal.\u201d  We all obsess about certain things, but mostly it is harmless.  But one can take things a bit too far.  Try to keep things in perspective.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Pop band Animotion.  It was originally written and recorded as a duet by songwriter Holly Knight and musician Michael Des Barres in 1983. This version was played in the film \u201cA Night in Heaven.\u201d  Animotion covered it a year later and released it in 1984 on their self-titled album.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cObsession\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Then it occurred to me there are many songs which seem innocuous but really aren\u2019t.  So we are going to have a theme about Obsessive people, or more commonly knows as Stalkers.

The one and only Bocephus, or Hank Williams, Jr.  The song was written by him and released on his 1981 album, \u201cThe Pressure is On.\u201d  This song is about being old, tired, but thinking about reliving the old days.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it! </p>\n<p>\u201cAll My Rowdy Friends (Have Settled Down)\u201d</p> </div>\n",

It was released in 1994 on their album \u201cWhere it all Begins.\u201d  It has a great Bo Diddley beat to it.

As we get on with our theme of being not as good as we used to, I often think of what could have been.  The choices I have made, what I did right and wrong and what might have happened if I had done something different.  I have no regrets, mind you, I have had a blessed life, and I am grateful for all of the good and the bad.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from an icon of music, Sir Elton John.  The song is the title track and was written by Bernie Taupin and composed by John for his 1973 album.  It is probably his best song, in mt opinion and never seems to get old.  The song \u201cis an image taken from the movie The Wizard of Oz. In the movie, Dorothy and her friends follow the yellow brick road in search of the magical Wizard of Oz, only to find they had what they were looking for all along. It was rumored that the song was about Judy Garland, who starred in the film.\u201d  (songfacts)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodbye Yellow Brick Road\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Things hurt more, things take longer, we go to bed earlier, we just can\u2019t do it anymore; not like we used to, anyway.  So this week\u2019s theme has songs about just that, \u201cBeing not as good as we used to be,\u201d especially when we go out and party.  When you also realize everyone you used to go out with doesn\u2019t.  We will start off a little soft this week, but it will definitely start rocking later in the week.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Jackson Browne.  Written by him and being the title track to his 1977 album of the same name, this is a classic song.  It is about being exhausted.

Even though Mondays tend to make me a little blue, I am thankful I have another one to try and get through.  Angels often have attributes to being the most lovely and beautiful beings in the universe.  So, it is natural, albeit a bit simple, that men have given these attributes to women.  We sometimes think of women as angels, sent to save us from ourselves.  </p>\n<p>\"O woman! lovely woman! nature made thee<br>\nTo temper man; we had been brutes without you.<br/>\nAngels are painted fair, to look like you:<br/>\nThere's in you all that we believe of heaven<br/>\nAmazing brightness, purity, and truth,<br/>\nEternal joy, and everlasting love.\"<br/>\n---Thomas Otway, Venice Preserv\u2019d, 1682\u201d.</br></p>\n<p>After that, we are going to the early 1980\u2019s, with a song I remember from my youth.  I think I even have the concert t-shirt somewhere.  Now, this song may not fit into the traditional image of Angels we have.  The band was The J. Geils Band, the song was form 1981.  It was written by Seth Justman and released on the album \u201cFreeze Frame.\u201d  It hit the top of the charts and stayed at number one for 6 weeks.

With the cold weather and football playoffs happening, it is time to cozy up and stay inside.  This week\u2019s theme will be about Angels.  Those wonderful, religious cherubim that have often inspired countless people to paint, write, sing and yes, even ask that they pray for us.  The English word \"Angel\" comes from the Greek angelos, which means 'Messenger.'  They were the messengers of God to all of us, and many artists have used this term to inspire them to write music.  Some good, some not so good.  Some were inspired by them and some just used the word to fir int a song.  We will have both this week.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great Jimi Hendrix.  It was written by him and recorded in 1970, but released on his posthumous album \u201cThe Cry of Love\u201d in 1971.

As we end our theme on RADIO, I lament a little of what it has become.  It used to be the place where you got to listen and enjoy great music.  There were countless times we would be partying (when we were younger), just sitting around with the radio on and enjoying life.  With the advent of technology and the internet and streaming, it just seems to have lost it\u2019s magic a little bit.  I know we now have more access to music, and that is great, but the spontaneity of it just seems a little less.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a classic.  It is from Steely Dan and I can think of no other song about the radio that could end this theme.  Written by Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, and released on the soundtrack to the film \u201cFM\u201d in 1978.  This song played well on the album-rock format stations back in the day.  For your enjoyment here is the extended  version.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cFM (No Static at All)\u201d</p> </div>\n",

But it was great when you could pick up something you didn\u2019t expect.  It was a special treat.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Texas greats, ZZ Top.  It is another tribute to the great Mexican radio stations form the past.  Written by Billy Gibbons, Frank Beard and Dusty Hill, and released on their 1975 album \u201cFandango.\u201d  \u201cThis song is a tribute to the \"Border Blaster\" radio stations in Mexico, specifically the two that were run by the famous disc jockey Wolfman Jack, XERF in Via Acuna, (near Del Rio, Texas), and XERB, (in Rosarito Beach near Tijuana). Mexican radio stations did not have to adhere to the power limits of US stations, which gave them the ability to pump their signal well into the States.\u201d  (songfacts)<br/>\nI hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cI Heard it on the X\u201d</p> </div>\n",

There are countless times, throughout my life, when I have been in a car, driving or riding, and a song comes on.  One that just makes the mood.  It hits you right between the eyes and is absolutely perfect.  It is like the DJ knew you needed to hear this particular song, and send it out, over the airwaves, just for you.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019 musical selection is from one of Canada\u2019s greatest treasures, Rush.  Written by Neil Peart, Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, and released on their 1980 album \u201cPermanent Waves.\u201d  The title was inspired by the slogan of Toronto\u2019s CFNY radio station.

One thing about listening to the radio growing up was the variety they let us have.  Not nearly as good as it is now with the internet, because everything way back then was controlled.  You had POP stations, Country, Rock, Adult Contemporary , Classical, and a few others.  The really good stuff was usually very regional and near the bottom of the dial.  Those were the radio shows put on by local DJ\u2019s and college kids.  You got the great Jazz and Blues shows, the \u201cAlternative\u201d stuff you didn\u2019t hear on commercial radio, the off-beat music that made your soul move.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a New Wave band Wall of Voodoo.  It was from the album \u201cCall of the West,\u201d released in 1982.  The song credits list the band as the writers.

As we think of Radio, we need to thank a few people for this great invention.  First, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, who discovered electromagnetic waves (which include radio waves), Second, James Clerk Maxwell for this theory of electromagnetic radiation, Third and fourth are Oliver Lodge and Jagadish Chandra Bose who worked on electrical devices for the detection and transmission of electromagnetic waves, and then we get to Guglielmo Marconi, who invented the machine to send and receive long distance radio communications.  For the history buffs out there-- \u201cOn 23 December 1900, the Canadian inventor Reginald A. Fessenden became the first person to send audio (wireless telephony) by means of electromagnetic waves, successfully transmitting over a distance of about a mile (1.6 kilometers), and six years later on Christmas Eve 1906 he became the first person to make a public wireless broadcast.\u201d (wiki)</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Elvis Costello and the Attractions.  It was written by Elvis Costello in 1977 and released as a single in 1978.  It was later added to the American release of his album \u201cThis Year\u2019s Model, which came out in 1978.  This is probably most famous because it got him temporarily CANCELED from Saturday Night Live for playing it.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cRadio, Radio\u201d</p> </div>\n",

The radio was so awesome, you never knew what would come on next, and there would be songs that could change your mood in a heartbeat.  You could go from being on top of the world to crying in an instant.  So we celebrate this great invention. </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from an English Punk  band, The Clash.  Written and released as a single in 1981 by Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon and Topper Headon.  This song was never released on any studio album of theirs, but several compilations.  This is probably my favorite song by them.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cThis Is Radio Clash\u201d</p> </div>\n",

But, that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t get cold, and when it is cold and snowy, the best thing to have is a good fire.  So this week will be all about FIRE.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is exactly what our theme is, it is on FIRE.  Written and released by the late, great Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1967, and on the album \u201cAre You Experienced?\u201d  \u201cDespite its sexual overtones, the song had an innocuous origin. Noel Redding, bass player for the Experience, invited Hendrix to his mother's house on a cold New Year's Eve in Folkestone, England, after a performance.[5] Hendrix asked Noel's mother if he could stand next to her fireplace to warm himself. She agreed, but her Great Dane was in the way, so Hendrix let out with, \"Aw, move over, Rover, and let Jimi take over\" (Shapiro, Harry (1990). Jimi Hendrix: Electric Gypsy)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cFire\u201d</p>\n<p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://vimeo.com/514541678\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://vimeo.com/514541678</a></p> </div>\n",

Which is odd, getting injured is easy, but being sick sucks.  So far it looks like I am getting over it, but it has been a rough couple of days so far.  Oh, and my cat ALSO got sick, $1000 in vet bills on top of having the Rona.

Remember the only thing we can control is our attitude, and hopefully, mine can be better than previous years.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great English rock group \u201cThe Zombies.\u201d  It was written by Chris White and is from their third album, \u201cOdessey and Oracle,\" released in 1968.  This album is ranked on \u201cRolling Stones list of the 500 greatest Albums of All Time,\u201d coming in at number 100.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cThis Will Be Our Year\u201d</p> </div>\n",

He is the reason this holiday has been around for so long, and unfortunately, we eventually commercialized the h#ll out of it.  Please don\u2019t get lost in the noise today.  Even if you are not a believer (which is fine, no judgement here) I believe the impact of this tradition makes the word a better place to be in.  I hope this day is a true blessing on you and yours.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a Christmas standard.  It is attributed to John Francis Wade, originally written in Latin in four stanzas. The earliest manuscript signed by Wade is dated about 1743. By the early nineteenth century, however, four additional stanzas had been added by other writers.</p>\n<p>This version is, of course, in Latin.  It is by Friar Alessandro Brustenghi, an amazing tenor.  He is truly inspirational.  This version is from an album released in 2013, \u201cVoice of Joy.\u201d   You will know this tune as \u201cO Come All Ye Faithful.\u201d</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cAdeste Fidelis\u201d</p> </div>\n",

My family tradition has always been to open our presents on Christmas Eve.  There was always dinner ( we would go out).  It is amazing, as when I was younger, we would be THE ONLY family in a restaurant on Christmas Eve, literally, the only ones.  Now it is hard to find a table.  How times change.  After dinner it was presents, then usually Midnight Mass, or sometimes we would go on Christmas Day.  But it was always great.  It was special because of the time with my family.  No matter what was going on, we were all together.  I hope your traditions are kept up and enjoyed.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the one and only Gene Autry.   It was written and performed by him and released in 1947 as a single.  It has been the de facto version of this song since it was released.

Especially when you get to the presents.  We all have to work very hard to make sure Santa stays relevant.

This group is The Crystals.  This is their version of a Christmas song written by J. Fred Coots and Haven Gillespie.

Believe it or not, the song was written by Steve Allen, the famous TV star from way back when.  It was released in 1953 and was the B side to a tune I played last year \u201c\u2019Zat You, Santa Claus?\u201d<br>\nThis is pure magic.  </br></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cCool Yule\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Time to get into the Christmas spirit if you aren\u2019t already.  There is a great feeling of love and enchantment in the air.  There is something very special about this time of year, almost like a romance.  Now, I realize it can be the opposite for some people; and if this is you, please know you are wanted, loved and appreciated.  Just hang out here, read and comment, listen and learn.  You will find few places in life as good as this one.  And if you need a pick me up, just ask.  We are here for you!</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Soul great Donny Hathaway.  He wrote this song with Nadine McKinnor and released it in 1970 as a single.  It originally flopped, but soon became a classic tune for the season, having been covered many times.  \u201cWhile a blizzard was dumping snow on Chicago in 1967, Nadine McKinnor, a postal worker, was singing Christmas carols to pass the time. She was thinking of Nat King Cole when she came up with the lyrics for this tune, not having a clue who Donny Hathaway was. \"I loved 'The Christmas Song' and was trying to capture the swirl of music, department store windows, lights on the South Side - Chicago at Christmas,\" she told the Chicago Tribune in 2017. \"It's like I'm talking about a love affair with the atmosphere of the holiday. My kids were little then, I was out shopping for toys, enjoying the mood. It's a romance with the season.\" (songfacts)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cThis Christmas\u201d</p> </div>\n",

We repeat a lot of things every year, especially our traditions.  We all do things we have picked up form either our family, friends, or others along the way.  These become our traditions we pass onto the next generations.  These also bring us a feeling of familiarity.

Since my divorce, I have split Christmas Eve/Day with my ex and the kids have always had to be two places.  It is not an ideal situation, but we make it work.  They always spend Christmas Day with her, which is good for me, as my family always did everything on Christmas Eve.  We always opened our presents on Christmas Eve.  However your tradition works, I hope it works out well for you.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s Christmas tune is one of the greats.  Last year I played the second-best version of this song, this year, the definitive one.  The song is one you all know, it is form Elvis Presley.  This song was originally written by Billy Hayes and Jay W. Johnson and first recorded by Western actor Doye O\u2019Dell in 1948.  The Elvis version didn\u2019t come out as a single until 1964, even though he recorded it in 1957.  This is a classic.  And we have the live version form his 1968 Comeback Special.  There is a reason he was The King!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cBlue Christmas\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Now for those of you who don\u2019t want to hear more of what you are hearing everywhere else, don\u2019t fret!  These tunes for the next two weeks will be ones you probably haven\u2019t heard before.  I will get to some classic ones on Christmas week, but for now, we are talking about the blue side of Christmas.   If you aren\u2019t with family, or things are going wrong, Christmas can be a little depressing.  So this week we have some songs about the season which are not so happy.  Please know you are loved and needed, especially here, so don\u2019t let it get you down if things aren\u2019t great right now.  Christmas is a time of Miracles!</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Hank Ballard ad the Midnighters.  The song was written by Hank and released as a single in 1963.  Hank Ballard was one of the first Rock \u2018n Roll artists ever in the 1950\u2019s.  He wrote \u201cThe Twist,\u201d made famous by Chubby Checker.  If you\u2018ve never listened to him, you should, especially if you like early Rock music.    </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cChristmas Time for Everyone But Me\u201d</p> </div>\n",

The day, traditionally, is when retailers started making a profit for the year, getting from the \u201cRed\u201d into the \u201cBlack.\u201d  So if you are shopping, have a great time, if not try to recover.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection most of you can already guess.  It is from the band Steely Dan.  Contrary to popular belief, this song is NOT about shopping.  It is about the failed attempt to corner the gold market by investors in 1869.  \u201con Friday, September 24, 1869 a failed ploy left many wealthy investors broke. The investors tried to corner the market on gold, buying as much of it as they could and driving up the price, but when the government found out, it released $4 million worth of gold into the market, driving down the price and clobbering the investors.\u201d (songfacts).  This song was written by Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, and released on their 1975 album \u201cKaty Lied.\u201d  This is from one of Americas greatest bands.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cBlack Friday\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Her mother said, \u201c\u2026at least I know what the worst thing to happen can be.\u201d  I am heartbroken for them.  I have a daughter, she is 22.  If anything happened I would be devastated.

Some songs about the holiday, some about food, and some just for fun.  With the heaviness of life, I think we all need a little break.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a Thanksgiving classic.  It is from the Vince Guaraldi Trio.

They always talk about what is going on.  Usually to the detriment of others.  It is just so hard for them to NOT put themselves into everyone else\u2019s business.   It is best to stay away form them, as they tell you everything about others, but they also tell others everything about you.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the world of Reggae.  I admit, I haven\u2019t posted enough reggae during the past year, but I will rectify that at some time in the future.  Anyway, this track is from none other than Bob Marley.  The song was written by him and Bunny Lee sometime in the late 60\u2019s or early 70\u2019s.  It may, or may not, have been released as a single in the early 70\u2019s, not enough good info to tell, but it was released in 1998 on the album of the same name.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Chatterbox\u201d</p> </div>\n",

It was written by Jerry Ragovoy and was a Jazz tune.  First recorded by jazz trombonist Kai Winding and his orchestra in 1963.  It was covered with additional lyrics by Jimmy Norman by both soul singer Irma Thomas and then the Rolling Stones.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Rolling Stones recorded two versions of the song in 1964.  The first version (a looser arrangement featuring a briefer, organ-only intro), recorded in London in June 1964, was released as a single in the US, on September 25, 1964, and was included the following month on their US album 12 X 5. The second version (more tightly arranged and featuring guitar in the intro), recorded in Chicago on November 8, 1964, was released in the UK on January 15, 1965, on The Rolling Stones No. 2. The later recording is the version that receives airplay and appears on most \"best of\" compilations.  Both versions incorporate elements of Irma Thomas's recording, including spoken-word interjections in the chorus, a monologue in the middle of the song, and distinctive lead guitar.\u201d (wiki)</p>\n<p>This version is from October 25th, 1964, from the Ed Sullivan Show.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cTime Is On My Side\u201d</p> </div>\n",

It is hard to explain, but for me, there is just a certain something in the air.  What that was USED to be burning leaves, but you can\u2019t really do that anymore in the city.

This version is from Jazz great Cassandra Wilson form her 1988 album \u201cBlue Skies.\u201d</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cAutumn Nocturne\u201d</p> </div>\n",

There is nothing like watching and working to clear the fields of all the hard work over the summer.  Watching full fields get harvested, and then looking at wide expanses of what used to be food.  Now just dirt, plowed under and waiting for Spring.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Neil Young.  It is honestly one of the only songs of his I like, but it is a beaut!  Released as the title track of his 19th studio album in 1992.  It was written by him as a tribute to his wife.  And if you listen carefully you might notice Linda Ronstadt on backing vocals.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cHarvest Moon\u201d</p> </div>\n",

There are a lot of places we think of when this happens; the northeast, when the leaves turn, or most any place where you have a lot of trees.  But there are also the cities, which have this great contrast between what man has made and what nature provides.  New York City, and Central Park are probably the most perfect example of this.  Not only does the city change ass the weather cools but the Park sets the mood.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is just simply WONDERFUL.  It is a jazz standard composed by Vernon Duke in 1934. It ended up being in a Broadway musical Thumbs Up! in that same year.  This version is from the duo of Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong.  It appeared on their 1957 album \u201cElla and Louis Again.\u201d</p>\n<p>True joy listening to this one.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cAutumn in New York\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Since a good portion of the populace has misgivings about Monday\u2019s, I thought we would go a little sad and somber today.  Some people look at Autumn as a time for things to end, we look at the trees changing colors, seemingly dying.  We look at the weather turn colder and harder.  The days grow short and the night seems so long.  It is important to be able to deal with all things in life, as best we can, and grief and loss are among them.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a  little known Scottish artist, Paolo Nutini.  It was written by Paolo and Jim Duguid for his debut album \u201cThese Streets,\u201d released in 2006.  The song is about the passing of his grandfather when he was young, with whom he had a very close relationship.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cAutumn\u201d</p> </div>\n",

And most of the songs about this wonderful season are very mellow.  There will be some great jazz this week as well.  This theme is an interesting one; I find it interesting how seasons are branded into our brain cells in a certain way.  Summer is about being happy, Spring is about new life and new starts, Fall is about things coming to an end and winter is about harder life (except snow, which people seem to love).  So get ready to relax, contemplate and get ready for  the holiday season.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Van Morrison.  Written by him for his 1973 album \u201cHard Nose the Highway,\u201d it was not a great album, but this song is a great one.  Very few modern songs capture the mood of autumn in all of its splendor like this one.  It\u2019s a long one, but one to get you in the mood this beautiful Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cAutumn Song\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Like I said, NO JUDGING  on this one!  Now, having said that, I can see how you might question my credibility on this next track, but it is one that will make you shake you a$$ and hopefully relax and laugh at yourself.  Especially if you dress up like the horn section on this video.  It is from KC and the Sunshine Band.  Yes, that one.  It was written by Harry Wayne Casey and Richard Finch from their 1976 Disco album \u201cPart 3.\u201d  As cheesy at it is, it did hit number one on the US singles chart.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Your Boogie Man\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As we think about all of the fun stuff about Halloween, there are certain characters which are always brought to the forefront during this time of year.  Ghosts, ghouls, monsters and especially Vampires.  Whatever you decide to go as this year, being a vampire is always in style.  Even though the whole vampire thing took off a few years ago, I always thought it was super cheesy.  I like the old style better.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a favorite of mine this time of year.  It is from the band Concrete Blonde.  It was written by them as the title track of their 1990 album of the same name.  A truly underrated band, in my opinion, this is the classic Vampire song.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cBloodletting\u201d</p> </div>\n",

I don\u2019t know about you, but I never knew anyone who dreampt of being something average or sub-par.  For many of us, it was to be the Center Fielder.  It was the premier position on the field and the regularly looked at as the \u201cBest\u201d person on the team.  I hope you still chase your dreams, even if it isn\u2019t on the Baseball diamond.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is not the most recent song about Baseball I will post this week, but the one most of you are probably familiar with.  It was written by John Fogerty and was the title track of his 19825 album.  It is my generations Baseball song.  </p>\n<p>\u201cCenter field was the place where all the greats played. I had long decided that the right fielder, which was probably me growing up\u2014 if they had nine kids and No. 1 was the best player, then-No. 9 was in right field. But the center fielder was always the best fielder on the team. He was the power hitter and fast and could handle everything. If you think about all the center fielders who\u2019ve played the game, they\u2019ve normally been the best players, too.

One thing about Baseball is it created heroes; and none bigger than Joe DiMaggio.  So many people, from all walks of life looked up to him.  An amazing player, he was what everyone wanted to be.  He was the player everyone wanted to see.  There is a reason there are so many pop-culture references to him.  And no, we are not doing \u201cMrs. Robinson\u201d today, but I think it is a testament to his popularity, as it was written 17 years after his last game.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical theme is another oldie, but one from the heyday of Baseball.  It is from Les Brown and His Orchestra.  Written and released on 78 in 1941.  Betty Bonney provides vocal accompaniment on this great tune.  The lyrics paid tribute to Joe DiMaggio, were inspired by the fifty-six game hitting streak, and were aptly named Joltin' Joe DiMaggio.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cJoltin\u2019 Joe DiMaggio\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Everybody could relate to it on some level.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a bit more modern.  It is from \u201cThe Intruders,\u201d a Philly Soul group popular in the 1960\u2019s.

This song was written by Sister Wynona Carr in 1952 (possibly 1953).  Her real name was Wynona Merceris Carr, and she was a Gospel/Rockabilly singer from the 1940\u2019s and 50\u2019s.  No real commercial success, but an interesting fact; \u201cWynona was recorded in 1954 ... by the same Joe Von Battle who cut Aretha's first sides ... with Aretha's father, the Rev. C.L.

Nothing but wonderful things can happen, even id=f they sometimes suck.  In the end our attitude has everything to do with it.  Sometimes you just have to go back to the beginning and start over, hopefully wiser than before and keep at it until it works out.  Just follow the circle.<br>\nToday\u2019s musical selection is from the great Blues icon John Lee Hooker.  This song is actually a Christian hymn written in 1907 by Ada R. Habershon with music by Charles H. Gabriel.  It was then reworked by A. P. Carter in 1935.  Hooker originally released his version in 1974, but it was recorded in 1961.  Some amazing blues here, folks.  It can get you feeling right for a Phriday.  </br></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cWill the Circle Be Unbroken\u201d</p> </div>\n",

We are just waiting for something to break us out of the spin and bring some sort of finality to the situation. </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Canadian singer/songwriter Sarah McLachlan.  It was written by her for her second studio album \u201cFumbling Towards Ecstasy,\u201d released in 1994.  I remember this album, and song.

Many times when I think of love I think of just spinning in my own head, and in my own tracks.  Lots of effort, but no progress.  I have had the joy of love, and either lost it, had it taken or just plain screwed it up.  Such is life.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a newer band I am quite fond of.  A very soulful group named Durand Jones and the Indications.  The track was written by them for their second album \u201cAmerican Love Call,\u201d released in 2019.  They are just a great group, a very easy sound and very likeable.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cCircles\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Do you think of things as more circular or more linear?  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a queen of American music, Joni Mitchel.  While she isn\u2019t my style, there is no denying, she is amazing.   It was written by her for her 1970 album \u201cLadies of the Canyon.\u201d  \u201cIn this poetic song, Joni Mitchell tells the story of a child's journey to adulthood.

As we continue on with our \u201cCircles\u201d theme, there is definitely something to finding our way in this life.  From birth to death and everything in between.  From our parents, to us, to our children, the circle continues as we try to figure things out and make our own way.  We think we are so much different than people before us, but most of the things we experience, the REAL ones are exactly the same as our ancestors.  We just have it easier because of technology, which has given us a lot of convenience.      </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is one we have all heard.  It is from the great Elton John.  This song was written by him, with lyrics by Tim Rice, for Disney\u2019s 1994 film \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and was a huge hit.  I saw Elton perform this live, once.  His show was just him and his piano.  This song was one of his encores and it was amazing.

As we complete our theme about The State Fair, I hope you get to go out and enjoy everything yours has to offer.  No matter what, it will get you out of the house and completely destroy your wallet and your diet.  So go get a corn dog, eat a funnel cake, drink a $10 beer and see some pretty weird and amazing stuff.  And don\u2019t forget the ring toss and ride the Ferris Wheel.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is one we have to get in the WAY BACK machine for.  It is from Alvino Rey and His Orchestra.  He was an early swing band guitarist, and an amazing one at that (he pretty much pioneered how to play the Steel Guitar and even invented an electric amp in 1933).  This is Big Band music, so don\u2019t be shocked.  The track was written by Fred Stryker and released in 1942.  I will place a bio in the comments, for those inclined, it is interesting.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Ferris Wheel\u201d</p> </div>\n",

One of the things I love MOST about State Fairs are the people; I love people watching.  You see all humanity has to offer at the Fair, the good, the bad and the ugly.  If you are feeling down in the dumps, all you need to do is head to the fair.  You will see a Who\u2019s Who in mental health.  You will look around, and NO MATTER WHAT is going wrong in your life, you will see someone else and say \u201cAt least I\u2019m not THAT mf\u2019er\u2026\u201d  But also realize, someone ELSE is looking at YOU saying the same thing\u2026.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a short instrumental.  It is from a band from Tennessee specializing in instrumental music, Los Straightjacklets.  This song is from their 1999 album \u201cThe Velvet Touch of Los Straightjackets.\u201d  It was written by Danny Amis, Eddie Angel and L. J. \"Jimmy\" Lester.  This is just a fun song.  When I listen to it, it PERFECTLY brings back the memories of walking down the Promenade of a State Fair.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cState Fair\u201d</p> </div>\n",

When I think of the State Fairs I have been to there is always some sort of circus tent with all sorts of things, animals, clowns, acrobats and just generic fun stuff.  I enjoy those things, but I can\u2019t help but sometimes wonder what life must be like for carnies.  It must be brutal.  Not only must it be hard work, but to put up with the mass of humanity every day must be a chore.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is form Rock royalty, Leon Russell.  Written by him this was his debut single from his 1972 album \u201cCarney.\u201d  For those of you who don\u2019t know Leon, he is probably the greatest pianist in Rock and Roll history.  He had a career spanning 6 decades and wrote and played on just about everything you have ever heard.  I highly suggest you look into his career, you will get tired of saying \u201cI didn\u2019t know he played on \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cTight Rope\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As we get into the meat of our theme on State Fairs there is one thing I always enjoyed, roller coasters.  They were always a lot of fun, but I always liked the old, rickety, wooden ones.  There was a distinct chance it might fail.  It made it more exciting for me.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is form, and you probably have already guessed it, The Ohio Players.  It was written by them (James Williams, Clarence Satchell, Leroy Bonner, Marshall Jones, Ralph Middlebrooks, Marvin Pierce and William Beck) and released o their 1975 album \u201cHoney.\u201d  It is a great tune to get your week started, and a fun fact, the model on the album cover (which they poured honey over for the photo) got stuck to the floor and they had to literally pry her off of the ground after the shoot.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cLove Rollercoaster\u201d</p> </div>\n",

It was great, and I love sharing the music I like with her.  It was a late night, and this morning I am dragging, but it was worth it.  Sometimes mornings just have to be hard, it makes you appreciate the ones that go well.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the band I saw last night, Hall and Oates.  It was written by Daryl hall and John Oates for their 1973 album \u201cAbandoned Luncheonette.\u201d  It is a much more folk inspired tune bringing a very zen type of outlook to being jilted.  This is not the 80\u2019s Hall and Oates most of us remember.  It is a very easy tune to just relax to.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the Morning Comes\u201d</p> </div>\n",

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning, Pham!  Happy Wednesday!  I hope this middle of the week is the culmination of great things and eases you into a spectacular weekend.  As we continue our theme of Blue Jeans, I always enjoy the different styles (up to a point).  The most iconic iteration of the classic pant is, of course, bell bottoms.  I always though it was funny when the little skate punk kids in the 90\u2019s thought they had invented something original when they had wide bottomed pants.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a true legend, Eric Clapton.  Written by him and Bobby Whitlock, it was releases on the 1970 double album \u201cLayla and Other Assorted Love Songs.\u201d  The album was under the group Derek and the Dominos. This is a heartbreaking song about Clapton\u2019s unrequited love for Pattie Boyd, the wife of his friend George Harrison.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cBell Bottom Blues\u201d</p> </div>\n",

You can do anything in them.  They are simply great.  Although I do hate modern jeans.  The ones with holes in them, pre washed, weird pockets.  There is no soul in them.  You used to buy Levi\u2019s, they were dark blue, if you saw someone with faded jeans, you know they earned them.  And they were comfortable.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from an obscure one hit wonder.  A British artist, David Dundas.  It all started as a commercial jingle, then became so popular it was turned into a song.  It was written by Dundas and Roger Greenaway and originally released as a single in 1976, then on his debut, self-titled album in 1977.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cJeans On\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As we start to see the end of summer and begin the cooler temperatures it is time to break out the warmer clothes.  Time to trade in shorts for blue jeans.  So our theme this week will be about a great American invention\u2026Blue Jeans.  For the history buffs; Blue Jeans were invented in 1871 by tailor Jacob Davis of Reno, Nevada.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the one and only David Bowie.  This track was written by him and released in 1973 on his album \u201cAladdin Sane.\u201d  The B side of the released single was \u201cZiggy Stardust.\u201d    Bowie has said it was \"a smorgasbord of imagined Americana\", and this track surely is.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\"The Jean Genie\"</p> </div>\n",

It is Phriendly, it is comforting.  It is all those things we really crave as humans.  Life is hard, for everyone, everyone is fighting a battle we know nothing about; and sometimes we just need a beautiful something to get us by.    </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from an amazing singer/songwriter, Randy Newman.  This song was written by him for the Pixar movie \u201cToy Story\u201d in 1995.  It has been used in every sequel in that film franchise, showing just how important a song can be to the story line of a film.  It just has a great message, one I think we understand here in the Pham, but is somehow lost on a lot of people, or so it seems.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend In Me\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Good advice, an ear to listen, a crutch to lean on, a kick in the a$$, something to make you smile, or laugh, a hand up; it\u2019s all here.  Just ask and you will see the better side of humanity on Phetasy.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is form one of the greatest singer/songwriters (which seems to be a lost art) America has ever had, Carole King.  She wrote this song for her 1971 album, \u201cTapestry.\u201d  One of the all-time great albums, of any genre.

It always puts me a little out of sorts, but by the time I figure it out, it is the weekend again.  It does remind me of good friends.  When you need help, are just a little lost (or a lot), they show up, help out, and get you right.  Sometimes it is a big thing, sometimes a small one.  But always appreciated.  Being able to receive these small gifts is a blessing, but also remember you have friends, but you are also one.  Nothing better than helping someone in need.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great Bill Withers.

After last week, we need something good to happen.  While I couldn\u2019t be at <a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/Senator\">@Senator</a>\u2019s virtual wake (I do apologize, but my father just got home from the hospital) I began thinking about how wonderful this place is.  We have all thought it, there have been many posts (including some from me) about the value Phetasy brings us.  So, this week\u2019s theme is about Phriendship.  </p>\n<p>I was never the person who had tons of friends, I consider myself lucky, though.  I have about 4 or 5 people who I can truly count on.  Any time, any place, anywhere.  True friends.  I call them my trash bag and shovel friends.  You can call them (or vice versa) in the middle of the night, ask them to show up and bring a shovel and some trash bags and they will be there; no questions asked.  </p>\n<p>This place, more than anything, is a way for us to connect with others in a healthy way.  Sometimes good, sometimes bad, sometimes confrontational, but always respectful.  Phetasy is a Phriend.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is form American artist Andrew Gold.  Written by him and released on his thirds album, \u201dAll This and Heaven Too\u201d in 1978.  It was used as the theme song for \u201cThe Golden Girls,\u201d and fittingly so.  Thank you Pham, for making this place REAL.  Thank You <a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/bridgetphetasy\">@bridgetphetasy</a>, for allowing this to be.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cThank You For Being A Friend\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Throughout the year I have done themes based on how I feel or what holidays or events are going on.  It has been an absolute pleasure for me to do so.  I really enjoy thinking about and working on these themes.  Plus, as a bonus, it keeps me from posting political crap.  And I haven\u2019t received any complaints, so I am guessing you are fine with it.  </p>\n<p>I have wondered how long I can keep this up, so I guess we will see.  If anyone wants me to stop, please let me know.  There will be no hard feelings.  </p>\n<p>So, to kick off this Anniversary, we will have an anniversary song.  This song is from the Australian band \u201cThe Little River Band.\u201d  A band that got its name from a roadway sign.  This song was written by Beeb Birtles and David Briggs, and released on their third studio album in 1977.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy Anniversary\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As long as there have been leaders, there have been problems.  We often think it has never been this bad, or our time is so much worse than such and such.  History tells us differently, and even though it is an absolute disaster now, it has been worse and it will get better.  We may have to suffer for a while, or there may be unpleasant and diabolical things happen.  But we will persevere.   </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from one of America\u2019s greatest singer/songwriters; Billy Joel.  Written by him and released in 1989 on his album \u201cStorm Front.\u201d  The song references over 100 political, cultural, scientific, and sporting events between 1949 (the year he was born) and 1989.</p>\n<p>While not my favorite tune from him, it is very fitting.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cWe Didn\u2019t Start the Fire\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As we get into our theme on Disaster, I can think of no greater one than our current crop of \u201cLeaders.\u201d  What our leaders are doing, in ALL facets of their jobs, is an unmitigated disaster.  In EVERYTHING they are doing, every policy, every bill they try to pass, every time they open their mouths.  I expected things to get bad, and I honestly think they will only get worse for a while.  What did you expect when we have elected and reelected morons for decades.  We are definitely in for a long road.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the American Southern Rock band Molly Hatchet.  A staple of 80\u2019s rock radio this song was written by Dave Hlubek, Banner Thomas and Danny Joe Brown.  This has lots of guitars and lots of southern rock appeal.  It is the title track of their second album released in 1979.  Their album covers were great, almost like comic books.  This album cover art is by Frank Frazetta entitled \"Dark Kingdom.\"</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cFlirtin\u2019 With Disaster\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Everything I am seeing in the news is just awful.  So, this week\u2019s them is about Disaster.  What is happening in Afghanistan is just evil.  And I don\u2019t throw that word around lightly.  How we are handling it (or not handling it), and what will happen once we have left.  And EVERY BIT OF IT could have been avoided.  I know it is wishful thinking, IMO, but the entire, current administration should be charged with Treason; and then promptly hung.  Abandoning your own citizens and then also the locals to a horrible fate.  Inexcusable.  It is high time we took everything back.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Indie band 10,000 Maniacs.  Written by Natalie Merchant and Robert Buck, it was released on their 1987 album \u201cIn My Tribe.\u201d  This song is about child abuse and neglect.

I do remember we had a class when the sub walked in, we all, and I mean every student, just got up and walked out.  The look on that poor girl\u2019s face was priceless.  We all went to breakfast.  Back then you didn\u2019t get into too much trouble over things like that, and schools weren\u2019t locked down.  I feel bad for it now, but back then it was a great time.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is not that, it is a comedy routine from the duo of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong.

No matter how much we hated school, don\u2019t you DARE talk trash about it.  I can\u2019t count how many times we had to defend her honor against any would-be naysayers.  My school was hated, but there was nothing better than walking into a room full of people with your Letter Jacket on and looking around at them; with that \u201cWhat of it?\u201d smirk.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Beach Boys.  Great songs and great stories throughout their catalog, along with possibly the greatest album of all time to their credit.  Written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love, and released in 1963 this is definitely from a simpler time.  It is from the album \u201cLittle Deuce Coupe.\u201d  \u201cThe song features the melody of the University of Wisconsin's fight song, \"On, Wisconsin!\", although it is a tribute to Hawthorne High School, which the Wilson brothers attended. Hawthorne High School's fight song uses the same melody as \"On Wisconsin\".

The song was written by him and appeared on his 1983 album \u201cInfidels.\u201d  It is one of my favorite tracks by him.  It is about \u201cJumbis,\u201d a mythical demon or malevolent entity.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cJokerman\u201d</p> </div>\n",

If there was a Mount Rushmore of heavy metal singers, Bruce would be there.  The band is Iron Maiden, and the song was from their 1983 album \u201cPiece of Mind.\u201d  It was written by Bruce and Adrian Smith.  The song is loosely based on the myth of Icarus, who was imprisoned, and with his father (Daedalus) they escaped with fabricated wings.  They were put on with wax, and when he flew too close to the sun, the wax melted and he had a very bad day.  </p>\n<p>This is a live version, showing off Bruce\u2019s voice\u2026and he has a flame thrower\u2026.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cFlight of Icarus\u201d</p> </div>\n",

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning, Pham!  Happy Monday!  I hope you get your work week started off well.  As we start this week of mythological songs we go from Homer\u2019s Odyssey to the prelude, the Iliad on this one.  The Iliad is one of the best business books you can ever read.  It deals with many different people, their wants, desires and what drives them.  It also is about how you can be almost invincible when you realize your goals are more important than your life (as did Achilles).  You can do almost anything when you are willing to sacrifice everything.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Led Zeppelin.  Written by Robert Plant and Jimmy Page and released on their 1976 album \u201cPresence.\u201d<br>\n\u201cAlthough \u2018Achilles Last Stand\u2019 uses mythological imagery drawn from William Blake's Albion, the Atlas myth and the Greek hero Achilles, its lyrics centre around the group's travels during their exile.  The title is an ironic reference to Plant's August 1975 automobile accident, in which he severely injured his ankle, as Achilles was brought down by an arrow to his calcaneal tendon.  Plant was unable to walk for a year, and recorded much of Presence in a wheelchair; the working title of \"Achilles Last Stand\" was \"The Wheelchair Song\".  Group biographer Martin Popoff described Plant's lyrics:  Albion is a Blake reference, but it's also an ancient name for what would become England.  The Atlas Mountains, which span Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, are also referenced, but through a nice twist, the lyric referring directly to Atlas instead, the god who held the earth on his shoulders.  Within he [Plant] also relates his travels in Greece, Spain, Montreux, Jersey, and California, as well as what one internalizes from travel.\u201d (wiki, several references) </br></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cAchilles Last Stand\u201d</p> </div>\n",

This week is all about Mythology, so it may get a little weird; and their will be one hard rocker in the mix, so be warned.  I love reading the Classics, The Iliad, The Odyssey, The Aeneid, Oedipus, The Orestia, etc.  So much of our history and culture comes form these.  There is nothing we experience that wasn\u2019t written about by the classic authors, human nature doesn\u2019t change.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the first true Supergroup, Cream.  It was released in 1967 on their album \u201cDisraeli Gears.\u201d  It was written by Eric Clapton in collaboration with Martin Sharp.  It was inspired by the Lovin Spoonful\u2019s \u201cSummer in the City.\u201d (Rolling Stone)  Such a  great song, one of my favorite tunes by them.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cTales of Brave Ulysses\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As we finish off our theme on \u201cFences\u201d we need to remember they are not good or bad.  They are necessary, in my opinion.  You just have to be aware of what they are.  We all need boundaries; we need to know what the limits are.  Too many times people want to live in the gray, be able to do what they want when the feel like it.  They hate the black and white view of things.  But remember you HAVE to have the black and white to know what the gray is.  Without it you have relativism, and that leads to decay and disaster.  We are seeing that in our society now.  No boundaries, no definitive right and wrong; you can say and be and do whatever you want, with no consequences.  Even if it is ludicrous, not based in reality, and especially, if you belong to the \u201cElite.\u201d</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the band Paramore.  The song was written by Hayley Williams, Josh Farro and David Bendeth.  It was released on their 2007 album \u201cRiot!\u201d  A nice little rocker for your Saturday morning.

No worries this morning, we are back to the music.  What things have we decided on so far this week?  How many obstacles do we have yet to face and overcome?  Such is life, so let\u2019s just make sure we don\u2019t get in our own way.  Too often I find myself completely surrounded by my own notions of what is reality, when it is not the case at all.  We have all seen the picture of a dog stuck behind a fence, looking at a ball that has gone over; and 3 feet away the gate is open.  He doesn\u2019t know he can walk through the gate.  He is stuck behind what he KNOWS to be the barrier.  If I could kick myself every time this has happened to me, I would have no a$$ and a really strong leg.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the British Rock band the Rolling Stones.

They are intended to separate and to keep things in order.  We don\u2019t want any of the riff raff getting in, do we?  We do everything we can to repair our fences, make them strong.  We keep things in and keep them out.  \u201cGood fences make good neighbors.\u201d</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s selection is not music.  It is a departure from my usual posts, so please bear with me on this one.  This is a poem.  I think it is a great one; it is from Robert Frost.  This version is read by Alan Davis-Drake.  If you read it, there is a lot to unpack in this one.</p>\n<p>Mending Wall<br/>\nSomething there is that doesn\u2019t love a wall,<br/>\nThat sends the frozen-ground-swell under it<br/>\nAnd spills the upper boulders in the sun,<br/>\nAnd makes gaps even two can pass abreast.<br/>\nThe work of hunters is another thing:<br/>\nI have come after them and made repair<br/>\nWhere they have left not one stone on a stone,<br/>\nBut they would have the rabbit out of hiding,<br/>\nTo please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,<br/>\nNo one has seen them made or heard them made,<br/>\nBut at spring mending-time we find them there.<br/>\nI let my neighbor know beyond the hill;<br/>\nAnd on a day we meet to walk the line<br/>\nAnd set the wall between us once again.<br/>\nWe keep the wall between us as we go.<br/>\nTo each the boulders that have fallen to each.<br/>\nAnd some are loaves and some so nearly balls<br/>\nWe have to use a spell to make them balance:<br/>\n\u2018Stay where you are until our backs are turned!\u2019<br/>\nWe wear our fingers rough with handling them.<br/>\nOh, just another kind of outdoor game,<br/>\nOne on a side. It comes to little more:<br/>\nThere where it is we do not need the wall:<br/>\nHe is all pine and I am apple orchard.<br/>\nMy apple trees will never get across<br/>\nAnd eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.<br/>\nHe only says, \u201cGood fences make good neighbors\u201d.<br/>\nSpring is the mischief in me, and I wonder<br/>\nIf I could put a notion in his head:<br/>\n\u201cWhy do they make good neighbors? Isn\u2019t it<br/>\nWhere there are cows? But here there are no cows.<br/>\nBefore I built a wall I\u2019d ask to know<br/>\nWhat I was walling in or walling out,<br/>\nAnd to whom I was like to give offense.<br/>\nSomething there is that doesn\u2019t love a wall,<br/>\nThat wants it down.\u201d I could say \u201cElves\u201d to him,<br/>\nBut it\u2019s not elves exactly, and I\u2019d rather<br/>\nHe said it for himself. I see him there,<br/>\nBringing a stone grasped firmly by the top<br/>\nIn each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.<br/>\nHe moves in darkness as it seems to me,<br/>\nNot of woods only and the shade of trees.<br/>\nHe will not go behind his father\u2019s saying,<br/>\nAnd he likes having thought of it so well<br/>\nHe says again, \u201cGood fences make good neighbors.\u201d </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.mamalisa.com/mp3/mending_wall_frost_alan_davis-drake.mp3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mamalisa.com/mp3/mending_wall_frost_alan_davis-drake.mp3</a></p> </div>\n",

Well, who knows what the week will bring?  Every day is filed with decisions, some important and some not.  Often, we can get paralyzed by certain things, making us incapable of making that decision.  We can over analyze, rationalize and procrastinate.  We can worry about the outcome; \u201cWhat happens if I am wrong?\u201d  \u201cWhat happens if I make a mistake?  Well, very few things in life are permanent.  You really have to go pretty far out there to make a decision you can\u2019t recover from.  Remember we can always change direction; we can always correct our course.  Sometimes if I think of decisions as not the final thing, but just part of the process of getting there, it helps.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great George Strait.

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning, Pham!  Happy Sunday!  I hope this week brings you all you need, and a few things you want.  It\u2019s hot as hell here in north Texas, and I have been tearing out and rebuilding a fence. So, this week\u2019s theme is all about Fences.  They are great for keeping things out and also in.  They provide a barrier between \u201cUs\u201d and \u201cThem.\u201d  Such a great metaphor for many other things as well.  How do we build fences around ourselves to protect us?  How do we see everyone else\u2019s fences?  What are our \u201cFences?\u201d  Do they do the job we intend, or do they restrict our freedom?  Freedom from love, friends, life?      </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a true standard of American music.  It is a Western song, but this version is from The Great Satchmo, Louis Armstrong in a duet with the great Velma Middleton.  This is from a live recording released in 1955at The Crescendo Club.  This song was written in 1934, with music by Cole Porter and lyrics by Robert Fletcher.<br>\nI hope you enjoy it!</br></p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t Fence Me In\u201d</p> </div>\n",

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning, Pham!  Happy Saturday!  The weekend is here and another week has gone by.  We have time to relax or get things done.  But time is relative, and when I think about the stars, and just how long they have been here, comparing our time in this universe to theirs is very insignificant.  But know YOU are very significant, not only to those who love you, but to me and those of us here.  You are important, loved, needed and wanted.  No matter how bad we feel, or how rough things get, you are needed in this universe.  You are here for a reason.    </p>\n<p>\u201cDo not complain beneath the stars about the lack of bright spots in your life.\u201d\u2015 Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a classic we all know.  I can think of no better way to end this them on Stars than with Jewel singing a favorite nursery rhyme.  It was released in 2012 on a children\u2019s album of hers, \u201cTwinkle Twinkle Little Rock Star, Lullaby Versions of Jewel.\u201d  The rhyme itself has its origin in England, from a poem written in 1806 by Jane Taylor.  It is sung to the tune of the French melody \"Ah! vous dirai-je, maman\", which was published in 1761 (wiki).  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cTwinkle, Twinkle Little Star\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Countless dreams and thoughts about what they are, how they work and why they are here.

I once had a man who worked with me, it was at a large retailer, and he worked their part time.  H e was a high school teacher.  A great guy.  He was on a field trip to the beach one summer, and one of his kids got sucked out in an undertow.  He went out and saved him, but in the process lost his life.  At the funeral his daughter gave an amazing eulogy, we were all in tears.  He had an amazing life, one we never knew of.  He ran with the bulls in Spain as a young man, he taught a pet crow to untie peoples shoe-laces when they came over to his house.  Just odd, wonderful things.  But she mentioned she was looking around his house as they were cleaning things out.  She was looking for something she could take to remind her of him; but she then said something I will NEVER forget.  \u201cI realized, while I was looking for some thing that I didn\u2019t need an object, he gave me everything I will ever need as he raised me.\u201d  We all cried even more.  And at the end, she told us that in his will he requested this song to be played.  He was a truly bright star I will always see.</p>\n<p>\u201cMoonlight drowns out all but the brightest stars.\u201d\u2015 J.R.R.

Sometimes it is tough, sometimes not, but when we are halfway; we get a sense of what it takes to complete the journey, wherever that may be. </p>\n<p>Today we have a song that gives me goosebumps.  It is just stunning.  Written and performed by Country musician Roger Miller, it is just a classic.  Not only for this theme, but as a song.  It was released in 12965 as a single.  It is about being a hobo and traveling throughout the country.  II also found a stereo version of this one.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cKing of the Road\u201d</p> </div>\n",

This one is a bout a girl he was dating who he wanted to take on a vacation.

They are all in your contacts and you just find the name and hit \u201cCall.\u201d  I think technology has made us stupid, or maybe it is just me.  So, we have a little blues, as I thought it would be fitting for a Monday.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Blues great Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins.  Written by him and released in 1951 as a single.  Interesting notes here; \u201cIn the 1950s, \u2018Central\u2019 was common parlance for the central office of a telephone company.  If people needed help finding a number or placing a call, they'd ask for \u2018Central\u2019 and be directed to a telephone operator who could help them out.\u201d  </p>\n<p>I thought I would go deep on this one, folks\u2026.this is a great take from Songfacts.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis slow-crawling blues song has Lightnin' Hopkins asking a telephone operator to patch him through to his lover.  He has no luck getting her number or finding a way to get to her and ends the song singing about walking home in failure.  At least, that's how it appears on the surface.  Look closer, though, and there's something else going on here.</p>\n<p>The lyrics are subtly strange if you scrutinize them.  Hopkins explains to the operator that the bus lines have stopped and the train conductors won't let him ride anymore.  He ends the song with the words:</p>\n<p>I went walking straight back home<br/>\nI was praying in my heart asking Jesus:<br/>\n\"Oh, Lord, now what wrong have I done?\"</p>\n<p>That final lament can be heard as Hopkins simply wondering what he's done to have caused the Fates to separate him from his lover, but Azizi Powell, historian of African American culture, suggests a different interpretation at Pancocojams.</p>\n<p>Powell writes that the song actually combines blues and gospel.  She ties it to a tradition of songs that use phone lines and operators as metaphors for Jesus and Christianity.  It seems strange at first blush, but \"Give Me Central 209\" actually makes more sense if it's viewed this way.\u201d  songfacts</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cGive Me Central 209\u201d</p> </div>\n",

The things we did knew just seem different from what the kids know today.  One of those things was phone numbers.  I remember my home telephone number from when I was 9.  I remember my high school friends phone numbers from back then.  So, this week is songs about Phone Numbers.  Those things we don\u2019t even remember anymore.  I am enjoying creating this one, folks.  It\u2019s going to be a fun week!</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a true icon in American Music.  The song was written by Jerry Gray and Carl Sigman.  It was released in 1940 on 78 r.p.m. by Glenn Miller and his Orchestra.  It is a great tune!  The phone number is for the Hotel Pennsylvania in Manhattan.  Everyone who was anyone at the time played there at the Caf\u00e9 Rouge.  The phone numbers used to not be unified, like we have today, with Area Codes.  There were many different systems, but the 2L-5N (two letters and five numbers) was used often.  Thus, the number was PE6-5000.  </p>\n<p>Bonus points if anyone knows whose phone number was Murray Hill 5-9975.  I will also post a newer version in the comments.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cPEnnsylvania 6-5000\u201d</p> </div>\n",

There is something satisfying about plotting our retribution on those who have hurt us-- Ex\u2019s, coworkers who take credit for your work, that driver who cut us off (wouldn\u2019t it be great to have a button on your car that turned it into a monster truck, for just a moment)?  I think it may be some way for our brains to help us deal with injustice.  I think about how many times I have done this, and even though nothing happens, I feel better at the end of the exercise.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the New Wave band Blondie.  Written by Nigel Harrison and Debbie Harry and released in 1979 on their fourth album \u201cParallel Lines.\u201d  It was written after Debbie was stalked by an ex-boyfriend.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cOne Way or Another\u201d</p> </div>\n",

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning, Pham!  Happy Thursday!  I hope you have a great day today!  Retribution can often consume us.  There is such a drive for justice in our minds and souls.  Sometimes it can lead to very good things, and sometimes to ruin.  How do we deal with the slights that come our way?  As a younger man I was all piss and vinegar, as I got older (not sure if I am wiser) I have tried to calm down.  I still get angry, but now I usually do my yelling in a small room, by myself.  No need to subject anyone else to my stupidity.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Man in Black himself, Johnny Cash.  This song was written by a children\u2019s author, Shel Silverstein.  Johnny played it in 1969 at California\u2019s San Quentin State Prison and it became his biggest hit.  This song is about revenge, plain and simple.  It was released on the album \u201cAt San Quentin\u201d that same year.  That audio is really bad, so there is a performance from Denmark.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cA Boy Named Sue\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Thinking about the emotions involved in retribution there is anger and sorrow.  Generally followed by the wish to do unto others what they have done to you.  I know this is not the best way to live, and hopefully our brains take over from our emotions when this happens.  But those feelings can be so strong, and very few things can safely express our feelings like music.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Godfather of Soul, The Hardest Working Man in Show Business---James Brown.  Get this, it is off his 37th studio album, released in 1973.

As we think about retribution, we often wish for the other person to get what they deserve.  \u201cKarma is a b*tch,\u201d as the saying goes.  I have often felt slighted and wanted the other offending party to feel the same way.  I am not sure if that is on me for wanting that or for a desire for justice (if it is deserved, that is).

Getting payback for an assumed wrong.  Sometimes we feel it is justified, and it very well may be, but in the end, I wonder if it is ever worth it.  Now I believe in justice, and writing wrongs, but there is also a pang of forgiveness running through my soul.  But it is hard to be the better man sometimes; and justice is indeed needed if we are to be a functioning society.  Where do we draw the line?  At what point is retribution justified?  At what point is it not?  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a classic deep track.  It is from the band Mason Proffit.  It is a protest song, the people vs. Uncle Sam, and the two protagonists have been fighting injustice and finally realize they are willing to die for what they feel is right.  The retribution is from our own government, backed by the people.  Laid upon those who dare to disagree with the popular narrative.  Mason Proffit was a country rock band form Champaign Illinois, and released this song on their first album, \u201cWanted\u201d in 1969.  It was written by the founding brothers of the band, Terry and John Michael Talbot.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo Hangmen\u201d</p> </div>\n",

I get thrown off kilter a bit when we have Holidays, the days just don\u2019t seem to add up, it just feels like a Tuesday.   Yesterday I wrote about differences in our American culture.  These have given us some of the greatest music the world has ever seen.  From Jazz and Blues, to Country to Rock to R&amp;B/Souls to Rap and more.  No other country can claim this.  And it is BECAUSE we are different this is so.  And the simple fact so many different people like so many different types of music proves we can get along.  \u201cWhite\u201d people like \u201cBlack\u201d music, \u201cYoung\u201d people can like standards, \u201cOld\u201d people can appreciate modern music.  It doesn\u2019t matter our differences, just what brings us together.  Music can do this.  It has helped us right our wrongs, and bring attention to the things we need to do better.

As we continue to celebrate \u201cAmerica,\u201d it is one of, if not the most diverse country in the world.  A multitude of colors, races, creeds, traditions and stories.  It is what makes America great.  Even though everyone who came here was different, they all came to share in the commonality of freedom.  The hope for a better life.  Throughout our history this has been mostly true (save slavery, bet we rectified that with a war), and it has led to a wonderful accumulation of people.  Having traveled much of this country, and seeing it\u2019s differences, I am so proud of them.  I just wish certain groups would stop trying to destroy us through them, but bring us together.

I hope this blessed day and long weekend help everyone relax and enjoy themselves.  As you might guess, this week\u2019s theme is all about America.  I love my country, even though my grandparents were immigrants, they raised kids to love this country and the opportunities and freedoms it grants us.  I think too many of the recent generations have forgotten that, or never been taught it.  We reap what we sow, and I fear these will be trying times in the next couple of decades.  We are not perfect, never have been.  But the very things allowing us to become better are slowly being taken away from us, or twisted into something evil.  If we are to survive, we need to fight this authoritarianism and all it entails.  </p>\n<p>\u201cOurs may become the first civilization destroyed, not by the power of our enemies, but by the ignorance of our teachers and the dangerous nonsense they are teaching our children. In an age of artificial intelligence, they are creating artificial stupidity.\u201d\u2014 Thomas Sowell</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a standard when talking about songs for America.  It is from the country star Lee Greenwood.  Written by him and released on his 1984 album \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Good Love Comin\u2019,\u201d it is his best-known song.  \u201cGreenwood wrote God Bless the U.S.A. in response to his feelings about the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. He said that he \"wanted to write it my whole life.\u201d  \u2026I've always wanted to write a song about America, and I said we just need to be more united.\" (Ramsey Campbell)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d</p> </div>\n",

There are a lot of bugs I have no idea what they are.  I just smash them.  There are also bugs we have all heard of, but again, have no idea what they are.  One of these is the Boll Weevil.  So, a little lesson from Wiki\u2014\" The boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis) is a beetle that feeds on cotton buds and flowers. Thought to be native to Central Mexico,[1] it migrated into the United States from Mexico in the late 19th century and had infested all U.S. cotton-growing areas by the 1920s, devastating the industry and the people working in the American South. During the late 20th century, it became a serious pest in South America as well. Since 1978, the Boll Weevil Eradication Program in the U.S. allowed full-scale cultivation to resume in many regions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a fun one.  It is from American Rock singer Fats Domino.  It was written by Dave Bartholomew and Fats Domino, and released as a single in 1956.

Some fathers are not the best, after all, we are all human.  But we, as a society need fathers to be strong and present.  If you read Homer\u2019s Epic Poem \u201cThe Odyssey,\u201d one of the underlying themes is what happens to a society when the men are absent.  We are seeing what happens to our society when fathers are absent, and it is destroying us.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from \u201cThe Temptations.\u201d  The song was originally recorded by the Motown group \u201cThe Undisputed Truth\u201d in 1972.  It was written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong (of The Undisputed Truth) in 1971 but then rerecorded by the Temptations in 1972 for their album \u201cAll Directions.\u201d  This is number 1696 on Rolling Stone\u2019s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, so you get the full version\u202612 minutes of Motown for your Phriday.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cPapa Was A Rolling Stone\u201d</p> </div>\n",

My brothers and I were always in trouble, by the way (and we deserved punishment).  His version of justice was very simple.  He worked us to pay our penance.  So many days I remember my dad \u201cPunishing\u201d us by working all day in the yard, or the house, or someone else\u2019s yard.  I hated it then, but looking back I learned so much.  Not only to do things, but also about consequences.  One night, I was about 16 I came home after partying.  I thought I got in without my dad knowing I had been drinking, a lot\u2026.I was wrong.  Instead of yelling at me, or grounding me he simply woke me up at about 7am (it was a Saturday), gave me a gallon of bleach and a sponge and made me clean the bathrooms.  As you can imagine, being hung over and in an enclosed space with bleach (my dad would close the door so the smell wouldn\u2019t come into the house), I got sick, many times.  I guarantee my dad was outside just laughing his ass off.  But the lesson was learned.  You want to go out with the boys, you have to wake up with the men.  Don\u2019t do something you might regret.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical track is from the Godfather of Soul himself, James Brown.

I remember when my daughter was a newborn, and would fall asleep (FINALLY), I would try to catch up on chores, but QUIETLY.  Then all of a sudden, I would accidentally drop a spoon on the floor, and she would wake up.  Then my wife (at the time) and me, exhausted, would try and get her back to sleep.

If he stops moving, he falls asleep, so he just keeps doing things; all day, every day, as far back as I can remember.  My brothers and I joke the day he stops working is the day he dies.

Gratitude is a virtue, but why it is hard to sometimes be grateful I think is because the opposite is so easy to do\u2026.being envious.  Envy, one of the Seven Deadly Sins.  St. Thomas Aquinas writes, \u201cThe struggle aroused by envy has three stages: during the first stage, the envious person attempts to lower another's reputation; in the middle stage, the envious person receives either \u2018joy at another's misfortune\u2019 (if he succeeds in defaming the other person) or \u2018grief at another's prosperity\u2019 (if he fails); the third stage is hatred because \u2018sorrow causes hatred\u2019.\"  Jealousy is probably the easiest way to think about Envy, so guess what this week\u2019s theme is?   You guessed it \u201cJealousy and Envy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the American rock band \u201cThe Gin Blossoms.\u201d  It was It was written by lead guitarist Doug Hopkins, who was fired before it ever got big, and released originally on the group's debut album, Dusted in 1989.  It was then re-recorded on their breakthrough 1992 album, New Miserable Experience.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Jealousy\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Photographs are an amazing thing, and one of the most popular things photographed are women (go figure).  Entire industries are built on it, not just the sinful kind, but they are used to sell everything from high fashion to cheap beer.

It was written by the band and was originally released as a single in 1981, but it didn\u2019t take off until 1983, with the advent of MTV and their censored and Uncensored versions.  It is my favorite song by them, and I think one of their best works.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cGirls on Film\u201d</p> </div>\n",

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good evening, Pham!  A couple of thoughts.  </p>\n<p>This past weekend I made a long, round trip drive from Dallas to Louisville to watch my daughter play volleyball in a national tournament.  It was the last time I will get to see her play, as she graduated college last week and is off to law school.  Even though it was 850 miles each way, it was worth it (made it in 12 hours, by the way).  They took second in the college pool.  Ran into a buzzsaw of a team.  The only three matches they lost in all three days of the tournament were to that team.  But they played well and had a good time, I am glad I went.  It was wonderful to get a little more daddy daughter time.  I feel so much was stolen from me during the divorce, so I take what I can get.  </p>\n<p>While I was there, I met up with <a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/ghostrock\">@Ghostrock</a> and her husband for dinner and drinks on Saturday night.  It was a delightful evening.  Great food, good beer and drinks and amazing company.  What struck me the most about the experience is how we connected; it was immediate.  Amazing to think we have only ever interacted on this small on-line site.  And that is quite interesting to me, actually.  Having a great connection with someone you just met.  There is an old saying that you will know your friends more in the first moment you meet them than an acquaintance will know you in a lifetime.  I think this is true.  <a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/Jimbolaya\">@Jimbolaya</a> was in the area and we were in contact prior to, but our schedules didn\u2019t match up.  I can only guess it would have been a similar experience.  </p>\n<p>I think the lesson I am taking from this is the people here are wonderful.  The genuineness of everyone, I feel, is true.  I think that is why this place, created by <a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/bridgetphetasy\">@bridgetphetasy</a>, is just wonderful.  I know most of you know this but if you are new here, I just wanted to let you know.  There are great people here.  REAL people, not people pretending to be something they are not.  People with real problems, real joys, real beauty.  And reading some posts by someone, then meeting them in person, and having all of it match, is just icing on the cake.  </p>\n<p>I have had the pleasure of meeting several of you.  And the meet-ups have been just as wonderful.  There are a few of us in the DFW area as well; <a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/Serenity_Maker\">@Serenity_Maker</a> and @NickNeal, and <a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/brandonjames\">@Brandonjames</a> has even crashed at my house.  And I have spent time talking to <a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/Senator\">@Senator</a>, soon to be a DFW resident, I believe.  </p>\n<p>Thank you <a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/bridgetphetasy\">@bridgetphetasy</a>.<br>\nThank you <a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/ghostrock\">@ghostrock</a>.<br/>\nThank you <a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/Jimbolaya\">@Jimbolaya</a>.<br/>\nThank you @Serentity_Maker.<br/>\nThank you @NickNeal.<br/>\nThank you <a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/Senator\">@Senator</a>.<br/>\nThank you Pham!  </br></p>\n<p>Go out and meet some people.  You won\u2019t be disappointed.  I hope to see some more of you as time goes by.  </p> </div>\n",

Our fallen soldiers, our current soldiers, and our veterans.  The men who sacrificed all so that we may live this dream of an existence in the greatest country the world has ever known.  May we NEVER forget them.  </p>\n<p>\u201cAn old soldier, worn out in the service of his country, began playing the violin on the street to earn a living.  One day, on the streets of Vienna, his hand trembled so severely he could no longer play.<br/>\nA passerby stopped and said, \u201cFriend, you are too old and feeble.  Give me your violin.\u201d<br/>\nThe stranger played so sweetly a crowd soon gathered and coins poured into the hat of the old soldier.  The new violinist emptied the money into the soldier\u2019s pocket and played again, more sweetly than before.  Again the hat was filled with money, which was turned over to the veteran soldier.  The stranger finally handed the violin back and was on his way.<br/>\n\u201cWho is he,\u201d asked the bystanders? \"'Why, that is Bucher, the great violinist,\" someone exclaimed.<br/>\nAnd so it was.  The master violinist had taken the man\u2019s place, had assumed his poverty, endured his disgrace, played his music and earned his living.  He had made a sacrifice for that old soldier.\u2014Parable</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the legend, Merle Haggard and the Strangers.  The song was written by Redd Stewart and Ernest Tubb and originally recorded by Ernest in 1944.

She is just my little girl.  I know she is an adult, I know she will do fine, but still\u2026.</p>\n<p>What would a musical theme about daughters be without a country song.  Today\u2019s musical selection is from American Country star Tim McGraw.  It was released in 2006 and was written by him and Tom Douglas, and was featured in the film \u201cFlicka\u201d, as well as his album \u201cTim McGraw Reflected: Greatest Hits Vol. 2.\u201d   </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Little Girl\u201d</p>\n<p>l.,kio,.iZI&gt;Z</p> </div>\n",

I think if you have a daughter, the world just revolves around them.  I had two older brothers growing up, the only girl in the house was mom.  My generation was all boys, of the 44 or so cousins and direct relations, there were 3 girls.  When I found out I was having a daughter, I was terrified.  Boys are simple, they are noisy, get into trouble and break stuff, pretty easy.  But girls???  What do you DO with them?  Well, I figured it out, as I suppose we all do.  All I can say is girls are easier to deal with when they are younger and tougher as they get older.  I remember when Victoria was 4, she looked at me and said, \u201cDaddy, you just don\u2019t understand me.\u201d  I replied, \u201cYou\u2019re right, and I don\u2019t understand your mother either.\u201d  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Motown group \u201cThe Temptations.  The song was written by Smokey Robinson and Ronald White and remains one of their greatest compositions, instantly recognizable.  \u201cThe song was included on the Temptations 1965 album The Temptations Sing Smokey. In 2017, the song was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or artistically significant.\"  (wiki)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Girl\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As the theme is about Daughters, I am constantly reminded of how wonderful mine is, and what a great young lady she is turning out to be.  I remember reading to her every night when she was little, every night.  Her mother and I thought that was an important thing to do.  There is something special about holding your little girl and reading to her.  The world melts away, and you just want the best for her.  You would do anything for them.    </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the Billy Joel. It was one of the many singles release don his 1993 album \u201cRiver of Dreams.\u201d  \u201cIt was originally written as a prelude to the song \"The River of Dreams\" in the style of a monophonic Gregorian chant.  Joel had written English words in the chant describing a man who had lost his faith, and had then had the words translated into Latin.  He changed his mind upon hearing the recording, and incorporated it into the song \"River of Dreams\".  He later removed the interlude from the final studio version of that song and instead wrote lyrics to the melody that reflected his sentiment toward Alexa Ray, who was a young child at the time of writing.\u201d  (wiki)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\"Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)\"</p> </div>\n",

As tax day is coming up this week (in the USA), I thought it would be great to remind ourselves of all the money our government takes from us and spends on things.  Some of which are necessary, but many (most of what the politicians spend it on) are not.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is actually about WANTING to pay your taxes.  It seems, in 1942, during the war effort to beat Hitler and the Japanese, the composer Irving Berlin learned the federal government was going to undertake \"unprecedented income tax collections\" to support the war effort, so he volunteered to write a popular song to aid in the tax collection effort.

It reached number 1 on the U.S. Billboard charts, making it his second number 1 song.

Since it is Easter, this week\u2019s them will be about things Rising.  Rising above the torments of this life, the things breaking us down and the way forward through our struggles.  I understand not everyone in the Pham is religious, so we will have quite the odd mix of music this week, it should be fun.  </p>\n<p>Most of the greatest Easter music is Choral, and LONG, really long\u2026.so today\u2019s musical selection will be a short part of a longer piece.  It\u2019s only about 4 minutes but if you just clear your head while you listen and contemplate, it can be magical.  This song IS religious, so be warned.  Before Christ rose, he was killed.  His mother watched it happen, it must have been the ultimate in suffering.  Suffering is part of life, I think too many times we long for a life without it, but then we can only grow through trial and pain.  </p>\n<p>\u201cThe most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen.\u201d\u2014Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross</p>\n<p>We will listen to the last part of a work composed by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi in 1736; it is one of his most celebrated sacred works.  The original song is a from a 13th-century hymn to Mary, which portrays her suffering as Jesus Christ's mother during his crucifixion.  Its author may be either the Franciscan friar Jacopone da Todi or Pope Innocent III.  The title comes from its first line, \"Stabat Mater dolorosa\", which means \"the sorrowful mother was standing\". (wiki)  I will post the wiki link to the words of the entire song below, as well, if you want to read them; they are heartbreaking.</p>\n<p>There is something so peaceful about good Choral music.  Sung by Emma Kirby and James Bowman with the Academy of Ancient Music, this version is from 1989.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cStabat Mater - 12.

So, if you think it is hard today, just wait\u2026.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the second version of the rock group Van Halen.  I think it is one of the best songs of that line up.  It was written by them, and released in 1992 on their album \u201cFor Unlawful Carnal Knowledge.\u201d  I remember when this song came out.  I was in college, and it was a big help keeping me focused to get on with my life.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cRight Now\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Sometimes as we try to keep the straight and narrow path we trip and fall.  Sometimes by our own choices and sometimes by the malice of others.  Whatever the reason, we have to persevere and keep moving forward.  We will survive.  We HAVE to, there is no other choice.</p>\n<p>Now don\u2019t judge me on this one.<br/>\nToday\u2019s musical selection is from Gloria Gaynor, an American pop artist.  The song was written by Freddie Perren and Dino Fekaris and released in 1978 as a single.  A platinum selling Disco anthem, it is about finding strength after a breakup.  </p>\n<p>I know this is Disco, but it still has a great message.  I admit, disco is definitely NOT some of the greatest music there is, but it can help you get up, move around, and feel better.  Nobody ever got up, danced around the house and shook their a$$ to Bob Dylan.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI Will Survive\u201d</p> </div>\n",

It was released on 78, as a single.   </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cSpring Fever Blues\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Love is in the air, new life abounds and sometimes we just need to be a little more open to the softer side of life.  And sometimes, this softer side can make a lot of us cringe, especially men; but still, we need to remember life has its softer moments.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the soulful, sultry voice of Lou Rawls.  This is something to just groove with.  Written by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, it was released in 1977 off of his album \u201cUnmistakably Lou.\u201d  Frank Sinatra once said that Rawls had \"the classiest singing and silkiest chops in the singing game\".  He released more than 60 albums and sold more than 40 million records during his career.   </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cSpring Again\u201d</p>\n<p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://vimeo.com/397279026\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://vimeo.com/397279026</a></p> </div>\n",

Time to shake off the winter doldrums and get ready for the beauty of Springtime and new life.  Since yesterday was the first day of Spring, you guessed it; this week\u2019s theme is Spring.  </p>\n<p>The only proper way to start off a theme like this is from Vivaldi.  Of course, this is from the violin concerti \u201cThe Four Seasons,\u201d written around 17416-1717 and published around 1725.  This version has the accompanying sonnet across the bottom so you can follow it.  This, I think, is just one of those pieces of music that has become part of the fabric of the human soul.  It is just that good, and captures the season perfectly.  So please just put it on and listen while you get up and about.  This is the full version.  It features Voices of Music with Alana Youssefian on violin.</p>\n<p>Concerto No. 1 in E major, Op. 8, RV 269, \"Spring\" (La primavera)<br>\nI.  Allegro (in E major)<br/>\nII. Largo e pianissimo sempre (in C\u266f minor)<br/>\nIII.    Allegro pastorale (in E major)</br></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cSpring (La Primavera)\u201d</p> </div>\n",

I remember having to clean the carpets when I was a kid, we would shampoo them twice a year (I had two older brothers, we were pretty dang messy).  Move all the furniture, go to the store and rent the machine, spend all day shampooing and vacuuming.  Then not being able to walk on it for hours, and finally having to move everything back.  We would then place everything on little squares of wax paper just to make sure we didn\u2019t screw up the freshly cleaned carpet.  It is tough doing it but it does make a pretty big difference when you are done.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the band Steppenwolf.  This song was written by John Kay and Rushton Moreve and released in 1968 on the album \u201cThe Second.\u201d  This was a staple of the early rock radio, especially with the psychedelic crowd.

This week we have an interesting theme, something that happens once every year about this time.  It fills most of us with dread, but we know it has to be done.  But when it is completed, we all feel much better.  That thing is Spring Cleaning.  We will have a few days with two songs, and they will all, hopefully, get you in the groove for your chores.  We will have songs about cleaning, being dirty and some songs just to get you in the mood to get stuff done.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is an oldie but a goodie.  It is a blues song originally recorded as \"I Believe I'll Dust My Broom\" by American blues artist Robert Johnson in 1936.  As with many blues songs, it is based on earlier songs, the earliest of which has been identified as \"I Believe I'll Make a Change\", recorded by the Sparks brothers as \"Pinetop and Lindberg\" in 1932. (wiki)  In 1951, the great Elmore James recorded the song as \"Dust My Broom\" and made the song we all know and love.  (At least some of us, anyway).  But that is not the version you are going to get this morning.  This version is from the Texas band ZZ Top, from their 1979 album \u201cDeguello.\u201d</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\"Dust My Broom\"</p> </div>\n",

A lot of the choices and decisions we make happen to be about those with which we have relationships.  We can ALL say we have made some bad choices regarding the people in our lives, and sometimes these prove to be devastating.  But there are also the ones that save us, bring us back form the brink of destruction.  Say a prayer for both today, because they made us who we are.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from \u201cLos Bravos.\u201d  A Spanish rock band from the 1960\u2019s.  Odd, there are a lot of songs about \u201cChoices\u201d from the 1960\u2019s\u2026.Anyway, this song was released in 1966 from the album of the same name.  It is about a man being \u201cUtterly flummoxed by a girl who has left him. He wants her back, then reconsiders, since she'll only leave him again, putting him in even greater misery. Upon further reflection, he thinks maybe it would work out after all if she returned. She's not coming back, of course, but he seems to feel better believing he has a choice.\u201d  (songfacts)<br/>\nI hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cBlack is Black\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Dare to hazard a guess, to go someplace new, to choose to do things you don\u2019t know how to do.<br/>\nSometimes you just have to start walking before you can figure out where you\u2019re meant to go. Pursue what you love, what is life-giving to you as well as others.<br/>\nKeep walking in hope, but don\u2019t strain toward the mirage of a finish line. Your life is always about to change. Surrender to the journey. Be open to getting your feet wet stepping into the unknown.<br/>\nWhen you feel lost, there is no shame in stopping to ask for directions. If you\u2019ve written the route on a scrap of paper and it blows out the window, don\u2019t go back and try to find it. Rest assured, you\u2019ll find your way.<br/>\n\u2014 Emily Ruth Hazel</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection stays in the 60\u2019s.  It is from a New Jersey band formed in 1965 as well.  \u201cThe Young Rascals\u201d released this song in 1967.  It was written by Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati, and This was a follow-up to \"Groovin',\" and was a huge hit. It's a soulful ballad about the doubts of one's first great love, particularly when the love is one-sided. (songfacts).,</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cHow Can I Be Sure?\u201d</p> </div>\n",

This week\u2019s theme is about choices and decisions.  I have been thinking a lot, lately, about the choices we make, as individuals, and as a nation.  I see the cancel culture at work, the idiotic choices our elected leaders make, the stupid things each of us have done and I wonder; \u201cHow in the heck did we get here?\u201d  As a species, we have been around for quite a while.  You would think we might have learned a few things along the way.  But alas, perhaps not.  Every time I think we should know better, somehow human nature proves me wrong.  Every choice has consequences.</p>\n<p>\"Every decision is liberating, even if it leads to disaster. Otherwise, why do so many people walk upright and with open eyes into their misfortune? \"\u2014Elias Canetti </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from a New York rock band, formed in 1965, \u201cThe Lovin' Spoonful.\u201d  This song was written by John Sebastian and first released on their 1965 debut album Do You Believe in Magic.  It is a great song, and one that has a great 60\u2019s vibe to it.    </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cDid You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind\u201d</p> </div>\n",

If not, we get to start again tomorrow and see what we can do to make this world a better place.  I have an affinity for this song, it is one I have only ever listened to while I was employed.  If ever I was looking for work, I would always change the station if this song came on; call it a superstition, I guess.  But it always reminded me of the value of just working, no matter the job.  This was instilled, no, driven into me, by my parents\u2014\"There is honor in work,\u201d I am thankful for this.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen your work speaks for itself, don\u2019t interrupt.\u201d\u2014Henry J.

The great Neil Peart was not a part of Rush yet, he was added on the next album, and the rest is history.  But this track is just a powerhouse rocker.<br/>\n\u201cThis was the last song Rush played live, using it as the capper to their R40 Live tour, which ended on August 1, 2015 with a show at The Forum near Los Angeles. On the tour, they played songs in reverse chronological order, starting with their newest songs and working backwards, with the backdrops changing to reflect the era.\u201d  (songfacts)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Play this loud.</p>\n<p>\u201cWorking Man\u201d</p> </div>\n",

With this change it is time to prove myself all over again, which is never a bad thing, but it does take a lot of extra effort.

I have posted this before, but I don\u2019t think you can read this one enough\u2026</p>\n<p>Prayer of St. Francis De Sales<br/>\nDo not look forward to the changes and chances of this life with fear.  Rather, look to them with full confidence that, as they arise, God to whom you belong will in his love enable you to profit by them.  He has guided you thus far in life.  Do you but hold fast to his dear hand, and He will lead you safely through all trials.  Whenever you cannot stand, he will carry you lovingly in his arms. </p>\n<p>Do not look forward to what may happen tomorrow.  The same Eternal Father who takes care of you today will take care of you tomorrow, and every day of your life.  Either He will shield you from suffering or He will give you unfailing strength to bear it. </p>\n<p>Be at peace then, and put aside all useless thoughts, all vain dreads and all anxious imaginations.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is one of the classics of American music.  This is just Biblically amazing, period, no discussion.  It was written and recorded in 1964 by Sam Cooke on his album \u201cAin't That Good News.\u201d  It was inspired by events in his life, and became an anthem for the Civil Rights movement in the US.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\"A Change Is Gonna Come\" </p> </div>\n",

Really, it\u2019s 5 degrees outside, that\u2019s really COLD for these parts.  Anyway, I hope your week starts off well, as we continue our theme of \u201cTenderness.\u201d  And if you can\u2019t be tender, at least it is the second best day to buy candy.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the one-and-only Otis Redding.  This song was written by Jimmy Campbell, Reg Connelly, and Harry M. Woods. It was first recorded on December 8, 1932, by the Ray Noble Orchestra (with vocals by Val Rosing).  Another version, also recorded in 1932 was made by Charlie Palloy &amp; his Orchestra.  Ted Lewis (Columbia 2748 D) and Ruth Etting (Melotone 12625) had hits with it in 1933.  Bing Crosby also recorded it on January 9, 1933 for Brunswick Records.  A version by Bob and Alf Pearson was also released in 1933 (Wiki).  The version we all know and love was released in 1966, Otis was backed on his version by Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s, and Stax staff producer Isaac Hayes worked on the arrangement.  Talk about talent!  It also incorporates elements from the Duke Ellington\u2013Lee Gaines song \"Just Squeeze Me (But Please Don't Tease Me)\" from 1941.  Redding did not want to record this song, but Stax Records executives and his friends wore him down with a constant barrage of requests. When he finally recorded it, he did it with a pleading vocal that he was \"sure\" would not be released (Song Facts).  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cTry A Little Tenderness\u201d</p> </div>\n",

While my themes have been a little more serious lately, not this week!  I am still on my dissillusioned/revolution kick, but I think we all need a break from that.  This week is songs for all of you in love.  More to the point, being tender.  It is something I think is important, if you want to keep a relationship going.  Something I have definitely f----d up on in my relationships.  So, to help you out, and not make the same mistakes I have made, we have songs about being TENDER.   </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is one you can probably already guess, but for VERY good reason.  Elvis Presley starred in a movie with the title of this song as the name in 1956.  It was written by Elvis and  Ken Darby under the pseudonym \"Vera Matson\", the name of his wife.  This song is a musical adaptation of the Civil War song \"Aura Lee,\" published in 1861 by George R. Poulton and words by W. W. Fosdick. </p>\n<p>Talk about a classic\u2014I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cLove Me Tender\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Dylan recalled writing the song as a deliberate attempt to create an anthem of change for the moment. In 1985, he told Cameron Crowe: \"\"This was definitely a song with a purpose. It was influenced of course by the Irish and Scottish ballads \u2026 'Come All Ye Bold Highway Men', 'Come All Ye Tender Hearted Maidens'. I wanted to write a big song, with short concise verses that piled up on each other in a hypnotic way.

As we ease into our theme of government control and the destruction of civil liberties, we Americans always have had a love/hate relationship with our leaders.  We love to see \u201cOur\u201d side in power, and we hate it when the \u201cOther\u201d side has it.  Mainly because no matter where you stand, somebody in the government is trying to f%ck with you.  And we hate that.  When it becomes too much too bear, we eventually do something about it.  The first time it happened we had this little thing called The Revolutionary War, the second time it happened we had this other thing called The Civil War.  I wonder what we might call the next one?  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the artist Lesley Gore.  She was a pop singer in the 1960\u2019s and released this song as a single in 1963, she was 17 years old at the time.  It was written by Philadelphia songwriters John Madara and David White.  It is about relationships, but definitely encompasses a lot of the feelings Americans, in particular, have about our federal government, no matter which side of politics they are on.   </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\"You Don't Own Me\"</p> </div>\n",

I truly do hope it does, because with everything going on, I see a lot of anxiety.  And the potential for A LOT of unrest.  So this week\u2019s theme is about the government trying to control us.  The laws being talked about and proposed are nothing more than one side trying to control every aspect of life in this great country.  I fear it won\u2019t end well.  I see a lot of Civil Disobedience in my future\u2026..</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the great British band \u201cThe Rolling Stones.\u201d  Released in 1968 on their album \u201cBeggars Banquet.\u201d  This is touted as their most political song ever, and with lyrics like these, I can see why..</p>\n<p>\u201cEverywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy<br/>\n'Cause summer's here and the time is right for fighting in the street, boy</p>\n<p>Hey! think the time is right for a palace revolution, but where I live the game to play is compromise solution</p>\n<p>Hey, said my name is called Disturbance; I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the King, I'll rail at all his servants\u201d</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>\u201cStreet Fighting Man\u201d</p> </div>\n",

As we finish off our theme on Money, we have a favorite artist of mine.

This song was written by Frank Crumit and Frank O\u2019Brien one month before the stock market crash.  </p>\n<p>\"Everyone is overstretched and buying on margin despite the warning signs. It was a funny record on the day it was recorded, but considerably less so when it was released a few weeks later.\"  Crumit was a vaudevillian with a deep and abiding interest in folklore. He was reckoned to know around ten thousand songs, and popularized \"Frankie and Johnny\", \"My Grandfather's Clock,\" and many more. </p>\n<p>During the Depression, he became a star on radio's Battle of the Sexes, appearing until the day of his death on September 1943.

Written by Merle Travis about a coal miner, based on life in mines in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. It was originally released in 1947 on his album \u201cFolk Songs of the Hills.\u201d  The most famous version is by the legendary Tennessee Ernie Ford, recorded and released in 1955.  It was released as a single.  It sold 400,000 copies in the first 11 days after it\u2019s release; two months later it had sold over 2,000,000 copies, at the time, the most successful single EVER RECORDED.   One musical note, at the beginning Earnie is snapping his fingers, it was never supposed to be on the recording, the engineers left it there by mistake.</p>\n<p>This video is from the old Dina Shore Show, for those of you old enough to remember her.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSixteen Tons\u201d</p> </div>\n",

With all of the talk about Wall Street and how the elite are being completely hypocritical about things I thought it would be a good week to do a theme about money and how the people how the people in power try to use it and us to help themselves.  I will be sharing at least two songs per day on this topic.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from an American soul band from Philadelphia, \u201cThe O\u2019Jays.\u201d  This is the quintessential song about money, and one of my favorites.  Written and composed by Kenneth Gamble, Leon Huff, and Anthony Jackson; it was recorded for the album \u201cShip Ahoy\u201d in 1973.  You get the long version of this song, because I love you and you are worth it.</p>\n<p>For those of you rockers out there, I have also have placed below the version done by The Bullet Boys.  Their version was released in 1988.  Even though it was definitely an 80\u2019s metal band that stole their look for m the original Van Halen it is definitely an amped up version of this classic tune.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy them!</p>\n<p>\u201cFor Th Love of Money\u201d</p> </div>\n",

A week without Soul is never a good one, so we are going to make a stop in Motown.</p>\n<p>The Temptations recorded this track written by Norman Whitfield, Barrett Strong and Rodger Penzabene in 1968 and released it on their album \u201cThe Temptations Wish it Would Rain.\u201d  There is a sad history to this song.  Lyricist Penzabene had just found out his wife was cheating on him with another man.  Unable to deal with the pain and unable to stop loving his wife, he expressed his pain in the lyrics of this song and its follow-up on the Temptations' release schedule, \"I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)\".  Distraught, he committed suicide on New Year's Eve 1967, a week after the single's release.

This week\u2019s theme was going to be about revolution, as I am not too happy with the state of things; but I thought that might be a little dark, so as I reflected a bit, I decided we have all been fools to believe what others (read as\u2026our Federal Government) can do for us.  We have no one to depend on but ourselves.  We have allowed our government way too much power and now they are shoving it down our throats, and I fear it will only get worse.  So, this week we will listen to things about being foolish in our trust and our own stupidity.</p>\n<p>As I ponder the current situation, we all have our opinions.  What strikes me most is we have this fundamental need to WANT to believe in something or someone.  Probably in the hopes it will make things better for us.  It rarely does.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from The Doobie Brothers, specifically the iteration with Michael McDonald.  This track was written by Kenny Logins and Michael.  It was released in 1978 off the album Minute by Minute.\u201d  Interesting note, the song was one of the few non-disco No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 during the first eight months of 1979.  I think Michael's voice is simply amazing.  I can listen to him sing anything.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a Fool Believes\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Released in 1978 on his album \u201cBackless,\u201d and written by Richard Feldman and Roger Linn.  This is the second-best track on that album, which, let\u2019s face it, wasn\u2019t one of his best.  But this song is about when promises sometimes don\u2019t come to fruition.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cPromises\u201d</p> </div>\n",

This song is a traditional religious Irish Christmas carol originating from the County Wexford.  The subject of the song is the nativity of Jesus Christ.  The history of this song is fuzzy, and according to Wikipedia \u201c(it) is of uncertain origins and while it is occasionally claimed to be from the early Middle Ages (12th Century), it likely was composed in the 15th or 16th century based on its musical and lyrical style.  The song achieved a renewed popularity due to the work of William Grattan Flood (1859\u20131928), who was organist and musical director at St. Aidan's Cathedral in Enniscorthy.  He transcribed the carol from a local singer and had it published in The Oxford Book of Carols, putting Enniscorthy into most carol books around the world.\u201d  This version was released in 2008 on Yo Yo\u2019s album \u201cSongs of Joy and Peace.\u201d  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Wexford Carol\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Giving is a wonderful thing, and it is true that \u201c\u2019Tis better to give than to receive.\u201d  My gift to you today is this masterpiece.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical, selection (and tonight\u2019s Christmas tune as well), are from two of the most amazing musicians.  Both are masters of their craft, and to me represent the ultimate in musical expression in their respective disciplines.  One has the voice of an angel, the other the skill of a true master; both utilizing their true, God given talents.  Yo Yo Ma and Allison Krause teamed up for a song on his 2001 album \u201cClassic Yo-Yo.\u201d  The result is one of sheer magic.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSimple Gifts\u201d</p> </div>\n",

It was a theater in the round with 400 people, and he played with just a drummer and a Bass player; it was amazing.  He wore a purple suit and could have been a comedian he was so dang funny.  The jazz was wonderful.  He has since gotten really famous, and his concerts I have attended are much larger and less intimate.

He wrote today\u2019s song , which was released in 1973 as the lead single from the album Merle Haggard's Christmas Present, and was the title track on a non-Christmas album four months later. The theme is not only of Christmas, but also unemployment and loneliness.  Sometimes these things affect people very hard around the Holidays.   </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\"If We Make It Through December\"</p> </div>\n",

It is cold and rainy here in DFW right now, and you know how much I love that....So I needed something to warm me up.</p>\n<p>Tonight's Christmas joy is brought to you by The Royal Guardsman, an American rock act form the late 1960's.  This track was released in 1967.</p>\n<p>This tale tells of our beloved dog, Snoopy and his battle with the Red Baron at Christmas time.  The Baron has Snoopy at his mercy after a long dogfight, but instead of shooting him down he forces Snoopy to land and offers Snoopy a holiday toast.  Afterward, Snoopy and the Red Baron fly their separate ways, \"each knowing they'd meet on some other day\".</p>\n<p>This song references the 1914 \"The Christmas Truce\" of World War I which was initiated not by German and British commanders, but by the soldiers themselves.  The length of the cease-fire varied by location, and was reported to have been as brief as Christmas Day or as long as the week between Christmas and New Year's Day.  Trench-bound combatants exchanged small gifts across the lines, with Germans giving beer to the British, who sent tobacco and tinned meat back in return.  No Man's Land was cleared of dead bodies, trenches were repaired and drained, and troops from both sides shared pictures of their families and, in some places, used No Man's Land for friendly games of football.  The song even has the initiator correct as it was generally the German soldiers who called over to the British and initiated the truce and, in the song, it is the Red Baron\u2014a German WWI hero\u2014who extends the hand of Christmas friendship to Snoopy. (Wiki)</p>\n<p>This is a fun one, so I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\"Snoopy's Christmas\"</p> </div>\n",

If you are, Santa will put you on the \u201cNaughty\u201d list.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Robert Van Winkle, or as you know and love him, Vanilla Ice.  This song was released in 1990 as a B-side single and has sold over 2 million copies and was the first hip-hop single to top the Billboard charts.  It is based on the bass line from Queen\u2019s \u201cUnder Pressure.\u201d  Granted, it is a novelty song, but it is catchy.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it. </p>\n<p>\"Ice Ice Baby\"</p> </div>\n",

As much as I hate the cold, it does lead to some very good things.  I can\u2019t really think of any right now, but I am sure they are there.  The biggest issue with winter in the south is we don\u2019t get any of the fun stuff.  No wet snow, no beautiful winter scenes; we just get the cold temperatures, cold rain and ice.  It pretty much sucks.  The desolation and feeling brought on by the winter months are reasons, I think, we feel \u201cCold\u201d when we are rejected or when someone puts us down.  The rem is often used when this happens (e.g. \u201cSh%t, that was cold\u201d).</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection deviates from yesterdays by just one word.  It is from a great band, with historic people running in and out of its lineup over the years.  The band is from England, and is named \u201cRainbow;\u201d formed in 1975 by the great Richie Blackmore.  This track was recorded and released in 1982 and is from their album \u201cStraight Between the Eyes.\u201d  It is about the<br/>\nI hope you enjoy it. </p>\n<p>\"Stone Cold\"</p> </div>\n",

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning Pham!  Happy Thursday!  Craziness abounds.  I am following the possible fraud in our election and am amazed how little coverage it is getting.  The testimony is quite stunning, yet ZERO news coverage.  If this evidence turns out to be verified and true, this is the biggest crime in US history.  Yet no one wants to cover it, go figure.  And even if it is not, then you get to cover the embarrassment of Trump.  But again, no coverage.  I just don\u2019t get it.  \u201cI\u2019m so confused,\u201d as Vinnie Barbarino would say.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from one of the greatest Motown groups in history, \u201cThe Temptations.\u201d  They were formed in 1960 in Detroit, Michigan.  This hit was released in 1970 and written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong.  It was released as a single and was used to anchor their \u201cGreatest Hits II\u201d album.</p>\n<p>I will post two versions, the first one is a live version, I post it because the outfits and effects are amazing, but the audio is not great.  I highly recommend you don\u2019t watch this one if you are under the influence of a mind-altering substance.   The second is a better quality audio version.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\"Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)\"</p> </div>\n",

There are great things, and some not so great things, about family.  I will have my kids, as well as a niece and nephew over at my parent\u2019s house.  My mother will cook with the girls, and the boys will probably head to the garage and piddle.  Then we will eat, and listen to my dad tell stories.  And it will be wonderful!</p>\n<p>I hope you all have great family traditions you share and can make more memories from.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is a song written and recorded by American country music artist Hank Williams Jr. It was released in May 1979 as the fourth and final single and title track from his album of the same name.  I just love Bocephus, he was one of the last true country stars.

It turns what we have into enough, and more.  It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity.

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning Pham!  Happy Friday!  We have reached the end of the week, so a few days to go crazy or recharge, and then back to the grind.  These past two weeks have been a brutal assault on my mind.  First the election, and now the turmoil of the outcome, and then we haven\u2019t even reached the conclusion or fallout.  Sometimes it feels like you are just getting beat.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from The Allman Brothers Band.  Formed in 1969 in Jacksonville Florida by Duane and Gregg Allman.  This song was on released on their debut album \u201cThe Allman Brothers Band\u201d in 1969, but the best known versions are always the \u201cLive\u201d ones.  This particular version is from the album \u201cLive at the Fillmore East\u201d form 1971.  It is so good you get the whole enchilada, which takes up the entire side 2 of the final record.  That double album had four sides of music and only seven songs\u2026<br>\nThis song describes how I am feeling some days\u2026.</br></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhipping Post\u201d</p> </div>\n",

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning Pham!  Happy Thursday! Two more days until the weekend, so let\u2019s keep going.  Whenever I see politicians or the MSM I just can\u2019t help myself.  Lying is a living for them.  And as a result, I think we are much worse off as a society.  So much misinformation, or leaving out pertinent facts because it doesn\u2019t fit a prescribed narrative.  If it\u2019s one thing I truly detest, it is lying.  I remember being a very small child, and my mother caught me in a lie.  She made me eat half a bar of Ivory soap.  I learned my lesson, that is for sure.  I believe there isn\u2019t enough Ivory soap, nowadays.      </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from one of the greatest bands in history.  So great, in fact, their first Greatest Hits album has sold over 38 million copies.  Written by Glen Frey and Don Henley, for the 1975 album \u201cOne of These Nights,\u201d it was on the both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard Country charts at the same time.  It was awarded the Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Group.  Fun fact, the album version is decidedly longer than the version released as a single, from about six minutes to four minutes.  It is about wives cheating on their husbands, but the title speaks to what we see everyday, unfortunately.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cLyin\u2019 Eyes\u201d</p> </div>\n",

He wrote the song at his farm in 1968\u2026.In an interview (he) described the lyric more obliquely: \u2018It's rather a sad song.

I offer this salute to our Veterans.  Thank you for your service!  We owe you so much that can never be repaid.</p>\n<p>A few quotes and a parable.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him.\u201d \u2013 G.K. Chesterton</p>\n<p>\u201cNever was so much owed by so many to so few\u201d \u2013 Sir Winston Churchill</p>\n<p>An old soldier, worn out in the service of his country, began playing the violin on the street to earn a living.  One day, on the streets of Vienna, his hand trembled so severely he could no longer play.<br/>\nA passerby stopped and said, \u201cFriend, you are too old and feeble.  Give me your violin.\u201d<br/>\nThe stranger played so sweetly a crowd soon gathered and coins poured into the hat of the old soldier.  The new violinist emptied the money into the soldier\u2019s pocket and played again, more sweetly than before.  Again the hat was filled with money, which was turned over to the veteran soldier.  The stranger finally handed the violin back and was on his way.<br/>\n\u201cWho is he,\u201d asked the bystanders?  \u201cWhy, that is Bucher(?), the great violinist,\u201d someone exclaimed.<br/>\nAnd so it was.  The master violinist had taken the man\u2019s place, had assumed his poverty, endured his disgrace, played his music and earned his living.  He had made a sacrifice for that old soldier.\u2014Parable</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p> </div>\n",

He recorded a rough version of the riff on a Philips cassette player.  He had no idea he had written it.

It\u2019s mid 70\u2019s here in Texas and couldn\u2019t be more wonderful!  This week\u2019s theme will be \u2026.wait for it\u2026\u2026Waiting.  I chose this for a few reasons; first, we are still waiting for a winner in our election (even though the press has called it, we are still not done).  Second, this pause in the results is definitely anxiety invoking.  We want to celebrate or despair (depending on who you want to win), but we really can\u2019t, yet; so we are riding this emotional or intellectual roller coaster.  And third, there are some pretty darn good songs about waiting.   </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the three wonderful ladies from Detroit, the Supremes.  They were originally known as the The Primettes, when they started in 1959, but singed with Motown in 1960 and changed their name.  Recorded in 1966 and released in 1967 on their tenth album, \u201cThe Supremes Sing Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland.\u201d  Named for the song writing geniuses responsible for a lot of Motown\u2019s hits.

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning Pham!  Happy Thursday!  As we continue our election themed week of music; in the immortal words of Yogi Berra, \u201cIt ain\u2019t over \u2018til it\u2019s over.\u201d  We still don\u2019t have a winner, and probably won\u2019t for some time.  If 2020 has taught us anything, is that it could always get worse.  Considering the last time this happened in 2000, it went until mid-December, I wonder how long this will be tied up in the courts?  Although there is a lot of evidence of outright fraud this time, instead of just poorly designed ballots; my guess is we should all pack a lunch.  The only good news is, at least I am not cuing up \u201cThe Mob Rules\u201d from Black Sabbath.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical interlude (I feel like dj for an elevator company) is from an American singer, \u201cLenny Kravitz.\u201d This song was released in 1991 on his second studio album \u201cMama Said.\u201d  I just love this song, and any time you use the Phenix Horns from Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, you know it\u2019s good.  He wrote this song about his troubled marriage at the time, and has described his thinking as \"not just a depression, but a fog. I didn\u2019t know which way was up\".  Apropos for today, I would think.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt Ain't Over 'til It's Over\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Halloween parties are a great thing, but this year they may not happen, unfortunately.  </p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from the band \u201cOingo Boingo,\u201d and American band who released this track on their third album in 1986.  The song was featured in the film \u201cBack to School,\u201d featuring Rodney Dangerfield (great movie, if you are of that era).  It was originally recorded as a 12\u201d single and then cut down for air play.  According to Wikipedia, one of the lyrics in the song \"I hear the chauffeur coming to my door/Says there's room for maybe just one more,\" is a reference to \"The Bus-Conductor,\" a short story by E. F. Benson about a hearse driver, first published in The Pall Mall Magazine in 1906.  The story has been adapted several times and spawned an urban legend, with each version using the catchphrase, \"Room for one more.\"</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDead Man\u2019s Party\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Today is the first really cold day here in DFW (38F), on a side note, I am officially done with winter (Yes, I am a heat baby!).  Continuing on with Halloween I wanted to go back to something a bit novel and fun.  Two songs came to mind.  Which one to choose?</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is NOT Bobby \u201cBoris\u201d Picket\u2019s \u201cMonster Mash\u201d from 1962.  Although that is a great song, the one I am selecting is from a little earlier.  Shelby \u201cSheb\u201d Wooley was an actor more than a singer.  He was raised a cowboy and rodeo rider, and later appeared in dozens of westerns, both on television and in the movies.   For those basketball fans, he even appeared in the movie \u201dHoosiers.\u201d  But in 1958 he had a number one hit with this song for two weeks.  It is a sordid tale of how a monster descends upon earth because it wants to play in a Rock \u2018n Roll band.</p>\n<p>This is a great novelty song, and a lot of fun.  I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Purple People Eater\u201d</p> </div>\n",

They released it as a single in 1968.  But in 1970 Carlos took it, mixed it with an instrumental tune called \u201cGypsy Queen\u201d by G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3 and produced this musical classic.

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Good morning Pham!  Happy Sunday!  I hope your day is full of blessed wonder.  This week\u2019s theme is going to be Halloween, or All Hollows Eve, or also All Saint\u2019s Day.  We will have a week of songs celebrating witches and ghosts and all things scary, and no worries, Thriller is not on the list.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s musical selection is from Donovan, a Scottish singer who released his third album \u201cSunshine Superman\u201d in the fall of 1966.  This particular song will focus on the witches.  </p>\n<p>I was always fascinated by the fact witches would sometimes be given a trial by water.  The victim would be bound and then thrown into water.   Since witches were believed to have spurned the sacrament of baptism, it was thought the water would reject their body and prevent them from submerging.  According to this logic, an innocent person would sink like a stone, but a witch would simply bob on the surface. The victim typically had a rope tied around their waist so they could be pulled from the water if they sank, but it wasn\u2019t unusual for accidental drowning deaths to occur. </p>\n<p>Fun fact, during the Salem witch trials there were far more cases in Andover MA, than in Salem.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeason of the Witch\u201d</p> </div>\n",

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Listened to the latest WIW with Doug Schoen.  Seems like a nice guy, a Democrat that actually likes America.  That is a very refreshing thing to see.  </p>\n<p>He brought up a few points I completely disagree with and a few I agree with.  </p>\n<p>That the Republicans are advocates for Trump.  I find this completely false.  They hate him.  He is NOT one of THEM.  He is his own brand, and they can\u2019t stand it.  During the first two years of Trumps Presidency both the House and Senate were held by Republicans, and they got NOTHING done.  Very few Republicans are for Trump.  How many have come out in support of his re-election bid?</p>\n<p>His point about certain companies have their own foreign policies, which are not in the best interests of the USA was SPOT ON.</p>\n<p>Your point about how there is no current leadership from the US in the world, I wonder what you mean? We have a peace deal in Kosovo/Serbia, we have peace deals with Arabs and Israel; former countries that have said in the past that Israel has no right to exist.  We even have a possible peace on the Korean peninsula.  Name any other US politician who has ever done ANY of these things?  Or world politicians, for that matter?  Remember when war in Syria was going to be happen?  Or war with Iran?  Or how we were abandoning our allies in the Middle East?  Oh yeah, NONE of that happened.  Of course the current world leaders, who get nothing done, hate him.<br>\nBeing tough on Russia and China??  His points are absolutely incorrect.  His finances are open for all to see.  You say he won\u2019t stand up to Russia???\u2026.Who is the only POTUS to have Russian troops killed in action in the past 40 years?  It was Trump in 2017 in Syria.  What examples can you give of him being \u201cSoft\u201d on Russia?<br/>\nWe have placed tariffs on Chinese goods, which has slowed their economy.  All of the \u201cExperts\u201d said it would crush us, but we had the greatest economy in 70 years (prior to covid).  He called out China for covid, and was vilified for it.  We are also beefing up our presence in the South China Sea.  I agree, we need to do more, but that could lead to open warfare, especially in regards to Hong Kong.  I feel for HK, I have friends there, and it will not end well if left unchecked.  His point of standing up to China is good, but China really doesn\u2019t care too much about things.  For us to \u201cTell\u201d them to not cross a certain line, stop it.  They simply don\u2019t care; it leads to war.  I am not saying I don\u2019t agree with him on this, but the outcome would be ugly, for everyone involved.  </br></p>\n<p>Wanting to build consensus in US politics is absolutely asinine.  I want the right solution; consensus only leaves room for bad ideas.  </p>\n<p>For Trump \u201cGiving\u201d people reason for everyone to be their worst selves is a bad take.  YOU are responsible for your behavior, no one else.  If you let someone else dictate it, then that is on you.   IF he acts like an Ass, then that is his fault.   </p>\n<p>His comment on vote by mail with \u201cVague\u201d allegations is flat out untrue.  There are a lot of verified examples of this being a disaster, and rife with fraud.  </p>\n<p>I get that people don\u2019t like Trump.  I truly understand this.  But we have always complained about corrupt politicians ruining this country, forever.  Trump withstood a 4-year illegal investigation into his life and they found NOTHING.  If the FBI and DOJ looked into any other politician\u2019s life for that long, we would have no politicians left.  You may not like him, but he isn\u2019t corrupt (as far as we know) and he is getting results no other leader in the WORLD has gotten in only 3 years.  </p>\n<p>I wish the news was fair to both sides, because there are problems with Trump, but there are also things he has done right.  And too often (92%) he gets only negative coverage, and a lot of it is flat out lies.  This has only caused a lot of unnecessary anger and division.  All the while, as you mention, things which we should be worried about go unnoticed.  </p>\n<p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://ricochet.com/podcast/walk-ins-welcome-bridget-phetasy/doug-schoen-discusses-the-looming-threat-of-the-china-russia-axis/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://ricochet.com/podcast/walk-ins-welcome-bridget-phetasy/doug-schoen-discusses-the-looming-threat-of-the-china-russia-axis/</a></p> </div>\n",

So\u2026Today\u2019s musical selection is from a rather obscure band (at least for some of you).  Formed in 1967, in Michigan, Commander Cody and His Lost Airmen mixed Rock \u2018n Roll, Country and Western Swing.   It was great bar room country music.  In 1971, they released their debut album \u201cLost in the Ozone\u201d with this little gem on it.  The version I will post was recorded live in 1977 with Nicolette Larson singing.  I will post the original version in the comments, below.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDown to Stems and Seeds Again Blues\u201d</p> </div>\n",

Today\u2019s musical selection is from one of my favorite bands, an iconic quartet from the town of Birmingham, England, Black Sabbath.  Well known for their excessive drug use, they released their third studio album called \u201cMasters of Reality\u201d in 1971.  One particular song on that album was \u201cSweat Leaf,\u201d a song about, you guessed it, marijuana.  Supposedly, the coughing at the beginning of the song is from the guitarist Tony Iomi smoking a joint with lead singer Ozzy Osbourne.<br>\nBlack Sabbath is the grandfather of all heavy metal music, but I love that one of the categories this song is also under is called \u201cStoner Rock.\u201d</br></p>\n<p>Just say \u201cNo,\u201d kids.

I saw him play on the OU812 tour with Sammy Hagar as lead singer back in college, it was an amazing show.</p>\n<p>So many songs to choose from...Where to start?  Not only was he a great musician, but he could also write great rock music.  One of my favorite stories is he rewrote/rearranged some of Michael Jackson's \"Beat it\" when he went in to record the solo for that song, just to make it better.  I will post a screenshot of that in the comments.  Or when they were too busy to shoot a video for the song \"Dreams\" and just gave it to the Blue Angels to use, which was amazing.</p>\n<p>I guess the best place to start is at the beginning.  I will post a few other songs in the comments as well, just because I like them.  </p>\n<p>\"Running With the Devil\" is the first single from their debut, self-titled album in 1978.</p> </div>\n",

I hope everyone had a great weekend.</p>\n<p>Today's musical selection is a bit of a departure from what I normally post.  The song is \"Music\" by the rapper Erik Sermon.  This was released in 2001 and is a compilation of Erik adding his own lyrics to Marvin Gaye's \"Turn On Some Music\" (originally titled \"I've Got My Music\" ).</p>\n<p>Personally I am split about the use of sampling, especially in the world of rap music.  Sometimes I think artists are not creative enough to come up with something original, and somehow not as good as those who do.  But then you hear something like this, and you just bump this jam as loud as you can and enjoy it.</p>\n<p>I hope this gets you in a good mood today.  The last half of this song could be put on a loop and played all day...</p> </div>\n",

I can't help but think of everything we are going through, and about to go through, and how complicit the media and some of our leaders are in all of this division and strife.  </p>\n<p>The song is \"Candy Everybody Wants\" from their 1992 album \"Our Time in Eden.\"  I like this song because it sounds so happy and fun, but the lyrics are so dark.  The song is about big business and their willingness to satisfy the American desire for sex and violence, but I think it is appropriate now, as well.  I hope you enjoy it and don't get caught up in all of the madness.  </p>\n<p>If lust and hate is the candy<br>\nIf blood and love tastes so sweet<br/>\nThen we give 'em what they want</br></p>\n<p>Hey, hey, give 'em what they want</p> </div>\n",

But not to fear, we have beautiful music to help us traverse the day.</p>\n<p>Today's musical selection is from one of my all-time favorites, Carlos Santana.  This is from his 1971, third studio album \"Santana,\" sometimes referred to as Santana III.  \"Guajiara\" is also one of my favorite songs.  I can't really tell you why, because it is all in Spanish, which I don't speak.  I think it may be the phrasing.  </p>\n<p>The word \u201cGuajira\u201d originates from a native American tribe from northern Columbia.  Roughly translated it means country folk or country girl.  It is also a form of traditional country music from that region.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  The lyrics are below as well.</p>\n<p>Guajira Lyrics<br/>\nVamonos guajira, vamos a bailar (Let\u2019s go, girl, let\u2019s dance)</p>\n<p>Que lo que quieres guajira (Whatever you want, girl)<br/>\nSi tu quieres bailar (If you want to dance)<br/>\nYo te agarro la mano (I\u2019ll hold your hand)<br/>\nY vamos a bailar (And we\u2019re going to dance)</p>\n<p>Que lo que quiere guajira (Whatever you want, girl)<br/>\nSi tu quieres bailar (If you want to dance)<br/>\nVen ve len, ven ve len, ven ve len ve (And we will enjoy?)<br/>\nY vamos a gozar (Come on!)</p> </div>\n",

Usually I feel whatever mood I am in and select a song to fit.  Sometimes I see what is happening in the Pham and try to add some color.  Other times I wonder if I will freak some people out; it might be a little odd to go from Hank Williams, to Dvorak, to Al Green to Fugazi in short order.  We shall see....</p>\n<p>But today I was thinking about the ride we are getting ready to finish in the next month-and-a-half up to the election.  With all that is going on I figure this best sums it up for today--besides, we all need a little get up and go music for a Monday.</p>\n<p>This song was released in 1982 by the Gap Band on their 4th studio Album.  They hail from Tulsa, Oklahoma, so I heard a lot of them growing up in Oklahoma City.  The Wilson brothers had some great songs, and this is one of my favorites.  I hope you like it.</p>\n<p>\"You Dropped A Bomb on Me\"  </p> </div>\n",

This song was released in 1994 on their second album, entitled \"Second Coming.\"  I just love the groove of this song.  Its lyrics are a telling of the Passion of Christ, reinterpreting Jesus as a black woman.  It may be an odd choice of topic for a rock band, and for the record I do not think this is sacrilegious but nothing more than just a good song to listen to.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\"Love Spreads\"</p> </div>\n",

The first is \"America the Beautiful\" by Ray Charles, sung at the World Series in 2001.  It was originally released in 1972 on his album \"A Message From the People.\"<br>\nIf you are an American and this doesn't conjur up some emotion in you, you need to get checked out.  If your not in America, just listen to Ray, it is awe inspiring.</br></p>\n<p>The second is a spoken word piece, from the Man in Black himself, Johnny Cash.  It was from his, get this, his 47th album, released in 1974.  It is \"Ragged Old Flag.\"  His voice is simply amazing.  </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy them.</p> </div>\n",

This track is one of my favorites from them, it is from their 4th album \"East Side Story,\" which came out in 1981.  This album featured a few tracks which were very different from the band's usual New Wave sound.</p>\n<p>One of these is \"Tempted.\"  Chris Difford wrote this song while on tour, writing about failing relationships and the things he saw during a taxi ride to the airport.  \"The original story behind \"Tempted\" is we're going on another American tour. I got on a taxi and I started writing down what I saw lyrically. I don't know the course of time of how long it took, but then I gave Glenn the lyrics and then Glenn put the music to it. It's an extraordinary song. It's one of the most played songs that we have in our catalog.\"</p> </div>\n",

Everyone has memories of this event, and how truly horrible it was.  If nothing else, it reminds us that true evil does exist in this world.  And when left unchecked, bad things can happen.  It also reminds us of how we can come together, as Americans (and people of all countries) to stand up to it and come together.  With everything going on, we still have within us the capacity for love and grace to overcome anything.  That is one of the reasons I don't worry too much about the current climate of nut jobs in this country.  We will be fine.   </p>\n<p>As we pray for the souls we lost, and for those still affected, I can think of no better selection from modern music to share with you today than Aretha Franklin's \"Amazing Grace.\"  It is a live album, recorded in 1972 at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles, Ca.  She won a Grammy for this album and it is the largest selling Gospel album of all time.</p>\n<p>The Queen of Soul--</p> </div>\n",

He is talking here about shrinking the power of the state (England), and its overall power and influence over the people.</p>\n<p>History is wonderful, and can help us better understand what we are going through now.    </p>\n<p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://fee.org/articles/edmund-burke-s-little-known-speech-that-eroded-the-british-monarchys-command-of-money-and-power/?utm_source=Social&amp;utm_medium=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=2020_FEEDotOrg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://fee.org/articles/edmund-burke-s-little-known-speech-that-eroded-the-british-monarchys-command-of-money-and-power/?utm_source=Social&amp;utm_medium=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=2020_FEEDotOrg</a></p> </div>\n",

Maybe something a little mellow.  </p>\n<p>Today's musical selection is from the great Steve Winwood.  There are just some of his works I truly love.  From Blind Faith and especially Traffic (which will definitely be featured at some point).  However, this is from his second solo album, Arc of a Diver, released in 1980.  This particular song was not the big hit from this album, but the title track.  </p>\n<p>Reminds me of being in love...</p>\n<p>With you my love we're going to raid the future<br>\nWith you my love we're going to stick up the past</br></p> </div>\n",

I have begun posting a song every day for a couple of reasons.  1)  I love music (I have a very eclectic taste, as you will see).  2)  Music always helps me out.  It has played an important part in my life.  And 3)  I am hoping everyone here, if they need a little pick me up, can enjoy some of these songs.  </p>\n<p>Today's choice is from a GREAT soul artist, Bobby Womack.  This song is from his 6th studio album from 1974.  His voice is just stunning, the mood is wonderful and the groove, for lack of a better term, is just, well....complete.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.  </p>\n<p>Bobby Womack-You're Welcome, Stop on By</p> </div>\n",

Most notably, I.G.Y.  This stands for  \"International Geophysical Year\", an event that ran from July 1957 to December 1958.

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p><a class=\"tagged\" href=\"https://phetasy.locals.com/member/bridgetphetasy\">@bridgetphetasy</a> and pham, I was reading the Brothers Karamozov and came across a passage.  Somehow it sounded a little familiar and then I remembered Bridget\u2019s latest article for the Spectator--<br/>\n<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://spectator.us/twitter-stolen-life-addiction/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://spectator.us/twitter-stolen-life-addiction/</a></p>\n<p>She mentions \"Social media robs me of being present..\"</p>\n<p>It lets me realize what we are experiencing isn't new.</p>\n<p>It is in Book VI, Chapter 2. It is about the Elder Zosima recalling a visit by a mysterious man in his youth.</p>\n<p>There is a bit of a lead in, just to get you familiar, but the last paragraph is of interest, as it speaks of the isolation of man.  I think I see this in the piece written by Bridget.  How, even though it is \u201cSocial\u201d media, it really isn\u2019t.  It seems more and more to isolate people.</p>\n<p>I liked the way he looked at me as he listened. \u201cAll that,\u201d he said, \u201cis exceedingly interesting. I will come to see you again and again.\u201d</p>\n<p>And from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening. And we should have become greater friends, if only he had ever talked of himself. But about himself he scarcely ever said a word, yet continually asked me about myself. In spite of that I became very fond of him and spoke with perfect frankness to him about all my feelings; \u201cfor,\u201d thought I, \u201cwhat need have I to know his secrets, since I can see without that that he is a good man? Moreover, though he is such a serious man and my senior, he comes to see a youngster like me and treats me as his equal.\u201d And I learned a great deal that was profitable from him, for he was a man of lofty mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat life is heaven,\u201d he said to me suddenly, \u201cthat I have long been thinking about\u201d; and all at once he added, \u201cI think of nothing else indeed.\u201d He looked at me and smiled. \u201cI am more convinced of it than you are, I will tell you later why.\u201d</p>\n<p>I listened to him and thought that he evidently wanted to tell me something.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeaven,\u201d he went on, \u201clies hidden within all of us\u2014here it lies hidden in me now, and if I will it, it will be revealed to me to-morrow and for all time.\u201d</p>\n<p>I looked at him; he was speaking with great emotion and gazing mysteriously at me, as if he were questioning me.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that we are all responsible to all for all, apart from our own sins, you were quite right in thinking that, and it is wonderful how you could comprehend it in all its significance at once. And in very truth, so soon as men understand that, the Kingdom of Heaven will be for them not a dream, but a living reality.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd when,\u201d I cried out to him bitterly, \u201cwhen will that come to pass? and will it ever come to pass? Is not it simply a dream of ours?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat then, you don't believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou preach it and don't believe it yourself. Believe me, this dream, as you call it, will come to pass without doubt; it will come, but not now, for every process has its law. It's a spiritual, psychological process. To transform the world, to recreate it afresh, men must turn into another path psychologically. Until you have become really, in actual fact, a brother to every one, brotherhood will not come to pass. No sort of scientific teaching, no kind of common interest, will ever teach men to share property and privileges with equal consideration for all. Every one will think his share too small and they will be always envying, complaining and attacking one another. You ask when it will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first we have to go through the period of isolation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean by isolation?\u201d I asked him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age\u2014it has not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For every one strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction, for instead of self-realization he ends by arriving at complete solitude. All mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by himself and thinks, \u2018How strong I am now and how secure,\u2019 and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence. For he is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and the privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere in these days men have, in their mockery, ceased to understand that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort. But this terrible individualism must inevitably have an end, and all will suddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated from one another. It will be the spirit of the time, and people will marvel that they have sat so long in darkness without seeing the light. And then the sign of the Son of Man will be seen in the heavens.... But, until then, we must keep the banner flying. Sometimes even if he has to do it alone, and his conduct seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and so draw men's souls out of their solitude, and spur them to some act of brotherly love, that the great idea may not die.\u201d</p> </div>\n",

The setting, the stance, the colors.  Not only was she beautiful in appearance, but also in soul, her humanitarian work was amazing.  Her take here is stunning, I think it shows us what true beauty is.  Surely better than what passes for that today.</p> </div>\n",

        "content": "\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Not to overstate the obvious, BUT\u2026.over the past 20 years or so the news has gotten increasingly more partisan, divisive and factually incorrect.   I don\u2019t think we have a press corps anymore; we have propaganda machines.  Propaganda\u2014\"Information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.\u201d<br>\nI remember growing up when the news was 30 minutes, not 24/7.  Local news had 10 minutes of news, 5 minutes of weather, 5-10 minutes of sports and some fluff.  National news had 20 minutes of news, both national and international and about 10 minutes of interest stories.  Even when CNN came out with Headline News, 24/7, it was still just NEWS, on repeat, every 30 minutes.  Now EVERYTHING is politics.  It doesn\u2019t matter if it is the weather, sports, entertainment, human interest or anything else.  It is all driven to politics.  Your political narrative of choice is shoved down your throats, all wrapped around whatever news story just broke.<br/>\nWe never heard much about politics when I was younger, the elections were every 4 years, and you didn\u2019t really hear about them until about 6-8 months prior to.  The \u201cRule\u201d used to be you never talk religion or politics.  Now everything is politics.  Now we talk about the next election even before the current one is concluded.  I feel sad for my children, having to grow up in a world making politics the end all be all, and interweaving it into EVERYTHING.  I see it infecting every part of life, every conversation, every interaction; it permeates everything with a stench of iniquity, bathed in self-righteousness.  It creates a lot of unnecessary anxiety and we are distressing people.  This is truly sinister.  The fact my kids are bombarded with this propaganda, day in and day out is maddening.  And that most of this \u201cNews\u201d is not really news, but someone\u2019s bullsh%t opinion, put forth as news.<br/>\nI think this propaganda is like a drug.  And the media pushes this to some sort of end, mainly their influence, power and money.  We need a 12-step program for the media.  I long for a time when the news just reported the news.  Someone mentioned (paraphrasing, here) we used to listen to the news and then form our opinions, now opinions are fed to us as news and we have to figure out if they are true.<br/>\nHere is a great Steppenwolf song, \u201cThe Pusher,\u201d from 1968.  It is about drugs, but I think the media is a new drug dealer, and we can\u2019t seem to get enough.  My apologies if the language offends... </br></p> </div>\n",

You can WRITE for money, or pleasure, and do anything you want, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  And then there is RIGHTING, where you write what is the truth, no matter the consequences, simply because it is the right thing to do and say.</p>\n<p>You are doing the latter, which is admirable, considering it does cost you jobs, friends, influence, etc.  The path to the truth is never easy, mainly because I think there re so many people who just DON'T want to see it.  It messes up whatever beliefs they have.  </p>\n<p>We stand behind you.  Not just because we are here, or because we support you, but because you are fighting the good fight.  You are writing partly for yourself, to process these things, but also for others to help them process things as well.</p>\n<p>Don't worry about speaking the truth, it will lead you to where you want to go.  Even if others think it will lead you to ruin.</p>\n<p>\"When you want to help people, you tell them the truth.  When you want to help yourself, you tell them what they want to hear.\"\u2014Thomas Sowell</p>\n<p>Please keep RIGHTING, the world needs this more than they, or you, or we know.</p>\n<p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://spectator.us/rebuilding-metoo/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://spectator.us/rebuilding-metoo/</a></p> </div>\n",

She is the Patron Saint of Epilepsy, Insanity, the Mentaly Ill and all Neurological Diseases.</p>\n<p>I thought it was poignant to post as there is a lot of talk on this platform about mental, spiritual and physical struggles.  Especially with the latest WIW.  So whenever you feel you need some help, ask Saint Dymphna to say a prayer for you.

People going stir crazy, Bridget being sick, everyone looking for something a little uplifting.  I then realized I wanted to share it with you, and I wasn\u2019t really sure why.</p>\n<p>Then it hit me--the connection.  Phetasy has been a great escape for me, especially during our quarantined time together.  I feel there is much more than just posts to read and things to comment on.  I feel a connection with you guys (and yes, I use \u201cGuys,\u201d meaning guys and gals, and whatever other pronouns you may choose to use.   I\u2019m a little old fashioned that way).  I truly enjoy what you write, the struggles you have, the advice you give, the jokes you share.  It is probably the first time I can honestly say that a computer has made more than just a passive connection to reality.  </p>\n<p>Thank you.  </p>\n<p>Now for something I hope you will find uplifting.<br/>\nThere is an ex-football player, who was paralyzed on his right side during a play.  He became a motivational speaker and I think he is great.  His name is Inky Johnson.</p>\n<p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/inkyjohnson/status/1207275854415486979?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/inkyjohnson/status/1207275854415486979?s=20</a></p> </div>\n",

Lewis and it was written about the atomic bomb.</p>\n<p>I am a lover of history, and especially the perspective it gives.  For me it is the greatest teacher.</p>\n<p>I have edited this for continuity, and replaced the word \u201cAtomic bomb\u201d with \u201cCoronavirus.\u201d  I have CAPITALIZED all edits, so as not to deceive.  I apologize in advance to C.S. Lewis and the purists.</p>\n<p>In one way we think a great deal too much of the CORONAVIRUS. \u201cHow are we to live in a PANDEMIC age?\u201d I am tempted to reply: \u201cWhy, as you would have lived in the sixteenth century when the plague visited London almost every year, or as you would have lived in a Viking age when raiders from Scandinavia might land and cut your throat any night; or indeed, as you are already living in an age of cancer, an age of syphilis, an age of paralysis, an age of air raids, an age of railway accidents, an age of motor accidents.\u201d</p>\n<p>In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the VIRUS was invented: and quite a high percentage of us were going to die in unpleasant ways. We had, indeed, one very great advantage over our ancestors\u2014anesthetics; but we have that still. It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances and in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty.</p>\n<p>This is the first point to be made: and the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we are all going to be destroyed by VIRUS, let that VIRUS when it comes find us doing sensible and human things\u2014praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts\u2014not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs. They may break our bodies (a microbe can do that) but they need not dominate our minds.</p>\n<p>\u2014 \u201cOn Living in an Atomic Age\u201d (1948) in Present Concerns: Journalistic Essays</p> </div>\n",

If it really works, got to wonder why it hasn\u2019t been on the news. If it doubles every six days as they predicted on a report from Ohio, it isn\u2019t going to miss anyone.</p>\n<p>First symptoms or no symptoms. Please read.  ________________________________________</p>\n<p>CORONAVIRUS</p>\n<p>The new NCP coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days then how can one know if he/ she is infected? Latest information is that the incubation period may be up to 28 days<br>\nbefore the symptoms of COVID 19 are evident. By the time a person has fever and/or cough and goes to the hospital, the lungs are usually 50% Fibrosis and it's too late !<br/>\nTaiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning ;<br/>\nTake a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds.  If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stuffiness or tightness , etc , it proves there is no fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicating no infection.<br/>\nIn critical times, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air!</br></p>\n<p>SERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.<br/>\nEveryone should ensure your mouth &amp; throat is moist, never DRY.<br/>\nTake a few sips of water every 15 mins at least.<br/>\nWHY ?<br/>\nEven if the virus does enter into your mouth...drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your esophagus and into the stomach.<br/>\nOnce there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly...the virus can enter your windpipes and into the lungs.<br/>\nThat's very dangerous. </p>\n<p>Pls send and share with family, friends and everyone about this ! </p> </div>\n",

Rather, look to them with full confidence that, as they arise, God to whom you belong will in his love enable you to profit by them.  He has guided you thus far in life.  Do you but hold fast to his dear hand, and He will lead you safely through all trials.  Whenever you cannot stand, he will carry you lovingly in his arms. </p>\n<p>Do not look forward to what may happen tomorrow.  The same Eternal Father who takes care of you today will take care of you tomorrow, and every day of your life.  Either He will shield you from suffering or He will give you unfailing strength to bear it.<br/>\nBe at peace then, and put aside all useless thoughts, all vain dreads and all anxious imaginations.</p> </div>\n",

She was talking about how soft our society has become.  </p>\n<p>As a history buff, I love this sort of thing.

Good discussion points and a great follow through from your guest spot on his podcast.</p>\n<p>Excellent observation to not believe in politicians but believe in principals.  Notice the few politicians who actually DO stand up on principal are blackballed in Washington.  I truly believe D.C is like the a mix of the Wizard of Oz meets Frankenstein.  If we were ever able to pull back the curtain on our Federal Government and truly see what is going on we would be marching with torches and pitch forks and burn it to the ground, no matter what side you support. </p>\n<p>Politicians have ALWAYS used people as tools, just read history, it isn't new.  I think it just more easily seen given the state of technology today.  </p>\n<p>Please know there is good in the world, you are proof of that, just by trying to seek it.  Some of your beauty is putting yourself out there, just allowing us to be encouraged by your actions.</p>\n<p>\"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, \u201cWho am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?\u201d Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we're liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.\u201d\u2014Marianne Williamson </p> </div>\n",

It reminds me of a quote--</p>\n<p>\"This is the true joy in life: the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community, and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work the more I live. I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no 'brief candle' to me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.\"\u2014George Bernard Shaw</p> </div>\n",
