It\u2019s officially the end of our Locals era. This means that starting now, all of our content will be centralized over at Substack and not Locals.</p>\n<p>As you can probably see, my life is getting increasingly more bonkers, in the best possible way--but that means dividing my time between two subscriber platforms is no longer sustainable. Consolidating all of the Pham in one place will make it possible to give you more of the focused attention you deserve.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t panic.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No action is needed from you right now.</li>\n<li>Anyone with a Locals subscription will be grandfathered into Substack and automatically moved</li>\n<li>You will hear from us on Substack if you have duplicate subscriptions.</li>\n<li>Substack is giving the Phetasy Pham the white glove treatment, which means if you have any problems or concerns, they will be able to help you resolve it quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Locals is where it all began so the move is bittersweet. I have made lifelong friends here. We\u2019ve done writing prompts together. Worked out together. We survived COVID and traded sourdough recipes. You overwhelmed me with gifts, blankets, and words of wisdom when I had my child. We even held a Zoom memorial for a member of the Pham we lost.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a wild and glorious ride--and the good news is--we will continue it all on Substack. Once you familiarize yourself with the platform, you\u2019ll notice some improvements, too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be able to DM other individuals in the community</li>\n<li>Subscribers can start their own chats and keep up with them more easily</li>\n<li>You can even start your own <a href=\"/newsfeed?search=writeclub\" style=\"float: none;\">#writeclub</a> if you want</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will be sunsetting the Phetasy Locals completely in two months. That should give you enough time to retrieve whatever writing prompts, images, or memes you want off the platform.</p>\n<p>Join us Friday night 5pm CT where I\u2019ll be hosting a livestream on Substack for subscribers to welcome you all to the new digs.</p>\n<p>Maggie and I are honored that you have chosen to support all things Phetasy and appreciate you sticking with us as we move into the exciting next phase of our many creative endeavors. We never take your time or resources for granted. Thank you for making what we do possible. </p>\n<p>We love and appreciate you.<br>\nBridget</br></p> </div>\n",

There's no argument made of how compeition is \"inherently unfair.\" There's no discussion of the \"mental health\" of subpar players who require this broken character to feel \"included.\" </p>\n<p>However, if a man puts on a wig and calls himself a woman, and demonstrates an unfair advantage by breaking multiple records by huge margins and winning repeatedly over female competators, it's called \"tolerance\" and lauded.</p> </div>\n",

And even though I\u2019ve had an account for a while, I\u2019ve never had much incentive to actively use it. I often end up there, cluelessly, when I click on links from other sites but feel so lost once I\u2019m there that I quickly leave. Now I must get familiar with it. </p>\n<p>Anyway, that wasn\u2019t what I wanted to share but there it is. </p>\n<p>Listening to this week\u2019s WiW, and suddenly felt a huge relief and gratitude that the lockdowns lead to the Pham. In a weird dichotomy, the pandemic lockdowns saved my life but not because it kept me from getting COVID. It gave me the first opportunity in over five years of being an unwitting workaholic at my previous job, to stop and take a breath and be able to see how crazy my work schedule had been. It was the beginning of the end and the beginning of me finally seeing how fucked up I was and start to get help. AND it gave me time to do things like listen to podcasts where I first heard Bridget on Rogan. </p>\n<p>If none of that had happened, I likely would never have found this place, and realized that there were sane (? \ud83e\udd23)humans. </p>\n<p>Seeing an NPR post about Sheryl Crow selling her Tesla and donating the money to them, pushed me over a little edge. I remember hearing stories about Elon\u2019s bad behavior towards his babies\u2019 mamas years ago. No one seemed to mind him so much then. And I have to assume all these folks (one is an acquaintance of mine) making a big show of getting rid of their Teslas didn\u2019t have a problem during all the Twitter drama??? </p>\n<p>UGH, rant over. I feel like I\u2019m becoming as insufferable as those I\u2019m complaining about. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f</p>\n<p>And the IRS story on WiW made my head implode.</p> </div>\n",

I love this goal because it's like double motivation. I'm willing to make the extra push at the end of the day or week to get that cash, since I know I'll be investing it in communities that a) give me the sanity to keep going and b) are pushing back against the systems that want to crush us.<br>Stoked to have joined the Pham today :)",

Repressed anger is a bitch to process. Anyway, I suddenly said to myself, \u201cI feel so fucking angry\u201d as opposed to my usual, \u201cI AM so fucking angry\u201d and it created this little space of detachment in how I identify myself.
